DSP at the slow end of the spectrum...,22,a8fqa7,https://www.reddit.com/r/DSP/comments/a8fqa7/dsp_at_the_slow_end_of_the_spectrum/,8,1545464552.0,"Digital Signal Processing (DSP) is usually associated with high sampling frequencies, especially in the case of Audio DSP where sampling frequencies of a few kilo Hertz (kHz) to a few hundreds of kHz are common.

But DSP can be applied to any [time series data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_series) including those where sampling frequencies might be well below even 1 Hz.

In that case, what does 1 Hz even mean?

In many fields with data in the form of time series, the sampling frequencies that are feasible or nominal are very low by nature, so much so that some times instead of stating the sampling frequency, the *sampling period* is stated. For example, in [Astrometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrometry), celestial targets may be moving very slow by nature, or frequent regular observations might not be possible because of occlusion. In financial time series, the [closing price](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/closingprice.asp) of a stock for a particular exchange is obtained once every 24 hours and in the analysis of [Infrasound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrasound) and seismic signals, the frequencies one deals with can be very, very low.

Frequencies below 1Hz, still have [submultiples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hertz#SI_multiples) such as milli Hertz and Yocto Hertz but what these correspond to (roughly) is less familiar when one is used to relating a frequency with a whistle.

So here is an example: Suppose that we sample a quantity once every 24 hours:

* The sampling period Ts (in seconds) is `24hr * 60min * 60sec = 86400 sec`
* The sampling frequency Fs (in Hz) is `1 / 86400 ~ 1.157407e-5 Hz` or `11.57407` **micro (u)** Hz
    * So, approximately 11.5 uHz is 1 period concluded in 1 day
    * Consequently `11.5/7 ~ 1.64285` uHz is 1 period concluded in 1 week
    * `11.5/30 ~ 0.38333` uHz or ~383.33 nHz (nano Hertz) is 1 period concluded in 1 month
    * `11.5/365 ~ 0.0315` uHz or ~31.5 nHz is 1 period concluded in 1 year
    * `11.5/(10*365) ~ 3.15068` nHz is 1 period concluded in a decade
    * `11.5/(100*365) ~ 315.06849` pHz (pico Hertz) is 1 period concluded in a century.
* The Nyquist frequency is 5.75 uHz which corresponds to 2 days. That is theoretically, the highest frequency that could be safely reconstructed without [aliasing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliasing).

So, there you have it, big yearly celebrations occur at a frequency of ~31.5nHz, [Halley's Comet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halley%27s_Comet) visits Earth at a maximum frequency of ~422.79722 pHz and the [planets of the solar system align](http://curious.astro.cornell.edu/about-us/57-our-solar-system/planets-and-dwarf-planets/orbits/246-when-was-the-last-time-all-9-planets-were-aligned-beginner) at a frequency of 63.41958 pHz.

[Here](https://descanso.jpl.nasa.gov/DPSummary/Descanso4--Voyager_ed.pdf) is perhaps the most detailed document outlining all the details that go into sending and receiving signals from the spacecrafts that involves a huge amount of signal processing.

The tides as the response of the Ocean to the input by the Sun and the Moon,19,aqnggd,https://www.reddit.com/r/DSP/comments/aqnggd/the_tides_as_the_response_of_the_ocean_to_the/,3,1550200774.0,"[This new video](https://youtu.be/L-3nkSdyto0) from the [SloMo Guys](https://www.youtube.com/user/theslowmoguys) has multiple cool points about it, like most of their work.

It's not only about that [large pool in Scotland](https://www.flowavett.co.uk/) that can simulate any type of wave and current pattern in it, it is also about [Jonathan White](http://jonathanwhitewriter.com/) talking about tides.

Unfortunately, the point of the ""experiment"" they setup to demonstrate the ""response of the ocean to the oscillations caused by the sun and the moon"" is missed completely.

And that is a shame, because it is a wonderful point and very relevant to DSP.

The tidal phenomenon and the development of tide theory is a fantastic journey through science and the development of awareness about our surroundings. If you want to find out more, I highly recommend [David Cartwright's ""Tides: A scientific history""](https://www.worldcat.org/title/tides-a-scientific-history/oclc/883555297&referer=brief_results) and [Tony Butt's ""Surf Science""](https://www.worldcat.org/title/surf-science-an-introduction-to-waves-for-surfing/oclc/895404190&referer=brief_results).

The point is this:

Imagine a solid spherical planet of some **constant** radius R, around the planet (that is, the planet does not have underwater mountains, ridges, valleys, etc) that is one big ocean (no land...anywhere). Despite the fact that the planet has a constant radius, the part of the ocean that would be directly on the projected position of the Sun or a Moon on the surface of this planet, would be **deeper**. Furthermore, due to the orbits of the planets, these ""projected positions"" of the Sun and Moon on the planet's surface, would move around and consequently, ""drag the ocean"" with them. From a fixed point of view on the planet's surface, this ""ocean dragging"" by the celestial bodies is experienced as one long wave, where the depth of the sea rises towards the high water and recedes towards the low water points of the tide cycle.

To say that ""the ocean responds to the input of the Sun and the Moon"" is to consider the planets,ocean and local tide as the input, medium and output of one giant mechanical system. Just like the surface of the membrane (the surface of the ocean) being excited by the combined waveform of two sinusoidal oscillators (the Sun and the Moon) in the SloMo Guys video.

Furthermore, this implies that we could obtain the impulse response of the ocean and then use that to experience how would the tide change with changing frequencies and strengths of surrounding celestial bodies. Just as we can obtain the impulse response of any enclosed resonator (e.g. an instrument or a room) and then use that to simulate how would that space ""sound like"" if it was driven by a particular combination of waves.

This of course is valid within limits, because the ocean is a highly non-linear medium and therefore, this linear way of modelling its response would not be entirely accurate. And this, is more practical than it sounds. This [giant ""bulge""](https://noc.ac.uk/files/documents/business/Double-Bulge-Explanation.pdf) of ocean water that travels along with the planets, actually has [its own gravitational pull](https://aapt.scitation.org/doi/10.1119/1.4985124) which needs to be taken into account when modelling these travelling waves. In other words, the bigger this ""bulge"" gets, the bigger it wants to become due to its own gravitational pull which, in DSP terms, introduces a dependence of the response to ""amplitude"" that is impossible to model with simple time invariant linear systems.

So, there it is, the ocean as one giant elastic speaker membrane, playing back the sounds of the Sun and the Moon.",2019-02-14 21:19:34

Feel free to add as you remember. Ill start:

Fresh out of college with my BSEE, I was asked in a phone interview 'how do you resample a signal?' I knew I had to zero pad between samples and then interpolate. Or something. I said that, but he said 'wrong you zero pad between samples and then filter.' heh. 

The thing is I clearly never remember having to decimate/upsample a damn thing up through the BSEE. 

Anyway, here is a list of what I can remember:

Q: ""How do you upsample a signal?""
A: ""Zero pad the signal by the appropriate number of zeros between samples, and then low pass at the new nyquist frequency.

Q: ""How can you make upsampling/downsampling faster?""
A: ""Use a polyphase filter"". (Real quick, polyphase works much faster because it never actually computes all those multiplies with zeros that you used for padding.

Q: ""How can you go even faster than polyphase?""
A: Cascade-Integrator-Comb filters. Also known as CIC's. They work by literally not having any multiplies just additions and delays. Sorry I dont know much more about them.

Instead of using the theory of distributions, which takes a fair bit of effort to develop rigorously, I was quite fascinated with the idea of relabeling diagrams which, surprisingly, is able to bring us the definitions and inversion formulas for DTFT and DFT without too much effort.

Some math background might be needed to understand the convergence conditions, but you can skip those if you are not interested (though you might find these justifications more satisfying than an intuitive proof using impulse trains).

I have Asperger's Syndrome (also known as Autism Spectrum Disorder, level 1). One of the consequences of that is that I have a lot of trouble with sounds: too loud is extremely painful, and I have a lot of trouble separating sounds (especially speech) from background noise, trouble using phones, etc.

I also do competition rifle shooting, and I have ""electronic"" earmuffs, that are rudimentary but effective: they are sound-isolating headphones, with a couple of microphones on the outside, and they relay sound to the inside, provided it doesn't exceed X db, at which point they cut out, and become just ear muffs. This way, I can safely hear the range officer without going deaf from rifle fire.

The combination between these factors and the small wonders you guys can perform with sound, makes me think that there is an opportunity for me to re-conquer a good portion of the world I feel forced to withdraw from. I want very smart noise cancelling. So I'm trying to figure out a way to design noise-cancelling headphones, iterating to the following outcomes:

1. To be able to set the ""too loud"" threshold to an arbitrary value. I expect this to be trivial?
2. To discriminate between speech and non-speech. I want to be able to have a conversation in a train station or a construction site.
3. To distinguish between ""foreground"" and ""background"" speech. I want to be able to go to a bar with my friends, and hear what they're saying without 50 independent conversations jumping all over my speech recognition impulse and overwhelming me.
4. To, on recognising ""foreground speech"", modulate it to a preset intensity so that even a loud talker doesn't blow my ears off.

My very limited knowledge of machine learning leads me to believe [Independent component analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_component_analysis) may be a starting point, but... frankly, if there are already off-the shelf solutions for this, some sort of ""sound processing pipeline"" with fit-for-purpose algorithms whose output I can pass to the next processing step... well, I'm not in search for technical purity and hack value, just... a solution I can use to make my life easier. Or is there actually a product that.. does this out of the box?

I recently graduated with an undergraduate degree in electrical engineering. During my schooling, I took various courses on linear systems, control theory, and a single course dedicated to digital signal processing. I very much enjoyed the course, however, I took this course my final semester of my undergrad and did not have the capability of take more classes. 

It had recently dawned on me that after the years of advancing my mathematics skills and learning about linear systems and controls, I've feel like I'm now at a point where I can truly appreciate the material. I'm at a point where I realize how little I know regarding the subject of DSP but have the capability to learn more on my own. As an example, I've recently taken up an interest in wavelet theory to analyze the time-frequency characteristics of signals. 

However, I'm bummed now that I'm out of school. Besides the obvious answer of grad school, I'm wishing there was a next step in guiding how I learn more about the subject. As of currently, my further pursuit of learning the material is just a mess of jumping from one subject to the next. 

My question: what's the best method for learning more about the subject of DSP from an intermediate to advanced level? It seems like the majority of the books I come across start at the basics of DSP and conclude at the discrete fourier transform. And when I do find a book on a more advanced topic, the entire book is dedicated to the subject.

So what I'm looking for is some tips for further pursing the subject of DSP from a non-beginner perspective. I'm looking for book recommendations, compiled lists of topics that you consider 'advanced fundamentals'. If it's any help, my main area of interest is audio and sensor data (i.e. not image processing). Furthermore, I'm incredibly intrigued with the concept of time-frequency analysis hence my previous mentioning of wavelet transforms. The idea of signal decomposition, statistical analysis, adaptive filters, and signal coding are all very interesting also.",2016-07-22 05:43:21

Has Fourier analysis monopolized our field in lieu of non-linear and machine-learning techniques? ,16,rjmlw,https://www.reddit.com/r/DSP/comments/rjmlw/has_fourier_analysis_monopolized_our_field_in/,17,1333075640.0,"
It seems to me that the FFT/DFT (and linear filtering in general) became popular in the 60s/70s/ (way before my time), but that this was simply because the processors that were around at the time didnt have the horsepower to do anything more complicated.

So naturally the field evolved to cater to those linear methods, with all the books, etc focusing on linear filtering, linear time invariant approaches linear this and linear that. It was always a linear system, and while noise, and stationary. I know this is because its easy to work with them... but still, I felt as though they were some pretty bold assumptions.

Anyway, upon taking some machine learning classes, I went to experiment with using them to solve some DSP problems that had previously stumped me and viola - it was SO much easier to solve them using those 'non-linear' methods and techniques.

Even with the DFT, this is one basis transformation out of so many... I think it might have been the only game in town back in the day, and when they discovered the NLogN FFT, then it became the only game in town. 

Towards the end of the 20th century we saw new basis transformations, wavelets, we saw strides in machine learning techniques thanks to AI researches, we saw strides in analysis of non-linear environments thanks to the biologists, but when I look at my DSP books a lot of those very powerful techniques seem to be missing, and its still linear this and white noise that...

There probably isnt a singular answer, (there never is), I liken it to perhaps some combination of its more likely for a fad to stick around even if there are new competing and comparable techniques, and also DFT got a head start too in the 50s/60s. Also, many of those ML techniques didnt exist back then, and are only now diffusing into our field.

Sawtooth with frequency-dependent decay,15,b6g40g,https://www.reddit.com/r/DSP/comments/b6g40g/sawtooth_with_frequencydependent_decay/,6,1553789464.0,"I've come up with a simple formula for a sawtooth wave with frequency-dependent decay:

    x(t)=(2/pi)*atan(sin(a*t)/(cos(a*t)+exp(b*t)))

Here `a` determines the pitch and `b` determines the decay. It turns out that all harmonics in this sound undergo exponential decay independently from each other, and the decay time of the nth harmonic is proportional to `1/n`, so higher harmonics die out first.

Proof: expand `atan` as the imaginary part of complex logarithm, then expand the logarithm as a power series around 1. We end up with a sum from n=1 to infinity of

    (-2/pi)*(-1^n)*sin(a*n*t)*exp(-b*n*t)/n

which is exactly the decay behavior described above.

For b=0 this is the Fourier series of a sawtooth wave, as you can also see from the original formula by the inscribed angle theorem. So for b>0 we get a plucking sound that starts as a sawtooth and then its higher harmonics die out first. You can hear it in [this demo](https://jsfiddle.net/yd4nv5Ls/). 

It sounds similar to Karplus-Strong, except in KS the decay time of the nth harmonic is proportional to `1/n^2`, so high harmonics fade even faster and low harmonics stay longer. I wrote an explanation of that [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/DSP/comments/b44c2x/a_palette_of_static_audio_waveforms/ej6l2hz/).

Also if you multiply the whole formula by `exp(b*t)`, that will stop the first harmonic from decaying, so the sound will morph from a sawtooth to a sine wave over time. Here's a [demo](https://jsfiddle.net/yv3zf8p7/) of that as well.

Also, it kinda blows my mind that a cosine = (e^(jwt)+e^(-jwt))/2. So basically, a real cosine signal is really a combination of two complex exponential with one positive and one negative frequency. Yet a complex exponential itself is made out of a real and an imaginary part. So it seems like a weird circular relationship.

So how does everyone here 'read' IEEE papers on DSP? Personally, I find a lot of them simply downright unreadable and hard to follow. Not all, but a good amount, so I am curious as to how everyone else tends to read them. 

Mind you, I went through a long learning curve before they are now ALOT easier than they used to be. However every now and then, I will come across one that is just painful to read. 

I do not understand why many authors do not _simply explain_ what they are trying to do/say, before delving into the details. This is natural and how science is taught/presented usually. 

Anyway, are there any general strategies for how you read IEEE papers? Do share! ",2013-07-08 23:07:53

Using a Raspberry Pi as a DSP device. Need advice and suggestions for audio filtering.,15,er3r87,https://www.reddit.com/r/DSP/comments/er3r87/using_a_raspberry_pi_as_a_dsp_device_need_advice/,8,1579502896.0,"For my senior design project as an electrical engineer (although my project falls slightly more CS) is to design a system that is basically room correction/equalization.

I will be using a measurment microphone to record the frequency reponse of an audio playback device/speakers. Then I hope to generate an audio filter from the measurment that will hopefully smooth out the response some.

Ideally the filtering will be able to be done in real time, but if not, it would be okay if it was a filtering process that processes and writes the filtered audio to a new file, instead of taking the audio in stream (not the mic, but audio from any source, like the pi, or an audio signal device plugged into the pi) filters and plays the adjusted audio back in real time.

Now I already have a USB audio interface up and running on my pi (have a 2B on latest raspbian now, can upgrade if necessary). So I am able to get mu microphone signal into the pi ane whatever audio in signal I would like to filter, and I can get a clean analog audio output.

My question begins with is my pi, or any available pi strong enough to filter audio in real time? If not, would it be possible to connect a seperate DSP IC with the pi and have it do the processing then return the audio to the pi?

Next, does anyone have ideas on where to start with:

A) Measuring frequency response

B) Generating a filter based on the FR measurments

I have read that REW (a FR measurement software) works on pi, albeit not super well. If I can get it to run on my pi, then all I would have to worry about is exporting the measurements taken by it and feed that into my filter generation/processing software.

Any help and advice is appreciated. I have done some googling and reading on forums and stuff, but if anyone knows of resoruces that may have info on similar applications, that would be helpful too.",2020-01-20 00:48:16

In the Boston-Washington area, I've seen a lot of openings for signal processing researchers at small defense-serving sonar/radar development firms.

Radar and sonar are both very mature fields, so what are the current unsolved problems in these domains?

I have a few starter questions from what I've begun to read online. For example, what ""problem"" is machine-learning or compressed and adaptive sensing for aerial radar or sonar trying to solve? Is MIMO beamforming a solved problem?

Lastly, defense radar/ sonar are relatively specialized, to the extent that none of my west-coast school faculty do air-facing radar/ sonar research and, as far as signal-processing goes, almost exclusively do medical/ geophysical imaging. How similar are the research problems in medical/ geophysical imaging to those in aerial radar/ sonar?

\~\~\~

As extra backstory, I ask all these questions because I'm trying to study modern (ML, compressed, statistical, etc.) signals techniques for a potential algorithm HW development role. Having a concrete sense of how these techniques lend themselves to radar/ sonar problems would really help motivate learning and reframe the mathematical results into useful tools for work, but most classes and online resources focus on commercial applications like recommendation systems or imaging/ video, so the connection to my potential job isn't obvious. While the abundance of material online and on-campus for commercial over defense applications makes complete sense, hoping someone here can help me make the connection. Thanks!",2019-11-07 10:24:54

I got a job writing applications in C#, Python, Matlab which exposed me to software design practices (OO, class design, unit testing, version control, UML, working with databases, algorithms, system-integration, etc.) but the application domain doesn't interest me.

I'd have a difficult time competing with someone who had graduated from a Masters program who had studied DSP.

Transition band steepness of IIR filter vs sample rate,14,cgpftf,https://www.reddit.com/r/DSP/comments/cgpftf/transition_band_steepness_of_iir_filter_vs_sample/,11,1563895537.0,"Hi

I'm used to working with FIR filters but never really done much with IIR filters. I'm investigating reproducing an FIR filter I currently use (500kHz HP, 111 taps, 40MHz sample rate) with an IIR filter. I have used scilab to play around with filter orders, etc. and I noticed something unexpected.

With FIR filters, if you want the same transition band steepness at a given frequency, if you increase the sample rate, you need more taps. However, I have tried generating the same IIR filter for 40MHz and 160MHz sample rate, and I seem to get the same transition band steepness with the same order.

Is this correct, and if so what explains the difference between the behaviour of IIR vs FIR? Or am I missing something in my analysis?

Today while working on a different project I was reminded of this idea. 

&#x200B;

So, I coded up a signal generator that can repeat a simple function every 'n' samples. I applied a 1-pole lowpass filter at the Nyquist frequency and used an oscilloscope to look at the resulting waveform. Here's what I found:

[https://imgur.com/a/iIdyf9Y](https://imgur.com/a/iIdyf9Y)

The functions I modeled were:

* sin(x)    →   cos(x)
* arctan(x)    →   1 / (x\^2 +1)
* exp(x)    →   exp(x)
* x\^2   →  2x

It appears that the lowpass filter approximates pretty well the derivative of the input function, sans some 'phase shift' business. Using an N-pole filter appears to derive the N'th derivative of the function, albeit with worse phase shifting. Some of the graphs needed to be rescaled to be visible 

Is this a well-known phenomenon already or maybe just plain obvious? I don't know how useful it is in a real-world context, but the idea popped up in my head again working on a process to find non-monotonic data relationships.

Is there any more information on this? I know about the z-transform and the process of differentiation and they seem very similar. Thoughts?",2020-02-01 21:20:21

Our resident DSP guy said it was a low-pass linear phase filter (so, smoothing), similar to a Gaussian filter in its characteristics, but nothing much else. Thing is, the values in the code are exact and deviate significantly from any Gaussian kernel or sampled values of a Gaussian I tried to fit to that filter, so I doubt it's just that.

I've found some resources on how it works, but it's still kind of fuzzy. Is there any fully fledged papers(for free) on ssw, open source implementations or (preferably) videos on how it works?

And if anyone can correct me on my high level understanding of SSW, this is what I think is going on:

1. Input audio comes in
2. decompose from the time domain to the frequency domain(fft or something of the sort, maybe something else if hardware implementation??)
3. Make the watermark in a small frequency range(kinda confused on this. How is the watermark(even if it's just an int) represented as a range of frequencies)
4. Spread the frequency range out(also kinda at a loss on this, seems like it's not just an evenly distributing the small frequency range across the audible frequency range?)
5. Somehow combine our range of watermark frequencies with the original frequencies. I've seen some different methods, from simply adding the frequency bins together, to some funky log stuff that I didn't look too hard at
6. Inverse Fourier transform or some other algorithm to transform the frequencies back to the time domain
7. Shoot the audio signal off to someone's set top box

Lets say I'm sampling at 48kHz. I want an FFT/bin resolution of 2Hz exactly.

48000/2 = 24000 (round up to next pow 2)

But this then gives me an FFT/bin resolution of..

48000/32768 = \~1.5Hz

Other than altering the sampling frequency, am I right in thinking that there is no way for me to now obtain an exact FFT/bin resolution of 2Hz? Even zero padding up from 24000 to 32768 still changes the bin frequency interval right?

Alternative to Karplus-Strong,11,b3ibai,https://www.reddit.com/r/DSP/comments/b3ibai/alternative_to_karplusstrong/,23,1553149006.0,"I've discovered that you can get a Karplus-Strong like sound by simply playing a looped buffer of noise through a lowpass filter with decreasing cutoff. (The cutoff should decrease sharply at first, then more slowly over time.) There's no need to modify the buffer as you go.

Demo: https://jsfiddle.net/byrsgkv7/3/ It uses a naive 4th order filter, but any other lowpass filter will work too.

Actually I like it more than K-S:

* Pitch depends only on buffer length. No need to account for filter delay, like in K-S.
* If you want to start at the 2 second mark, or run the decay backwards, you can. Unlike K-S where you must start at the beginning and move only forward.

IIR filter in VHDL verification,11,99dgdy,https://www.reddit.com/r/DSP/comments/99dgdy/iir_filter_in_vhdl_verification/,10,1534974265.0,"Hi

I am trying to learn a bit more about vhdl (fpgas) and DSP, thus I wanted to try and implement a simple IIR filter using Second order sections (coefficients generated with matlab). But I am having some problems on how to verify that the filter (the first section to start with) is working correctly. 

The filter structure and variable names used in the code.

When using matlab and its filter function (and only the first stage coefficients) I need a sample vector of around 30,000 samples before I can see it stabilize.

BeagleBoneBlack vs. DSP for embedded multichannel audio processing,12,1mgiji,https://www.reddit.com/r/DSP/comments/1mgiji/beagleboneblack_vs_dsp_for_embedded_multichannel/,5,1379312006.0,"Hey /r/DSP, I wanted to pick your collective brain about porting a bunch of code to a lower-cost embedded platform. I'm working with a really cool augmented acoustic instrument, the [Magnetic Resonator Piano](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f79d_oVqv4Y). 

There's a keyboard sensor (not the one in the video, but a custom-designed equivalent) that outputs continuous key position data at a 1kHz sampling rate via USB at about 2Mbps. This raw data is converted to MIDI and OSC messages by a custom application that also handles calibration and message routing. A second app receives the MIDI and OSC and does the audio synthesis, outputting up to 16 channels over a third-party audio interface that go to custom signal routing and amplification hardware to drive the electromagnets (usually we just run 6 channels over a PreSonus Firebox and deal with limited polyphony). 

Currently it runs as shown in the video, using a computer to do all the processing, but we'd like to obviate the need for an expensive Mac. I see two possible paths:

1. Port all the code to Linux to run on a BeagleBoneBlack with a multichannel DAC (something along [these](http://www.wolfsonmicro.com/products/dacs/WM8768/) lines)

2. Port to a DSP (something along [these](http://www.analog.com/en/content/sigmadsp_evaluation_boards/fca.html) lines)

Seems a BBB+DAC might be the cheaper option, and I'm guessing porting the code would be easier as well. I have very limited experience working with actual DSP boards (my senior design project in undergrad involved a DSP, but that portion fell mostly on my partner). I'm not entirely sure what the logistics are of getting serial data in over USB on a DSP (I'm assuming there would be built-in methods to do so).

Has anybody done any audio processing under similar conditions on a BeagleBoard and was its processing power sufficient? I'm sure the DSP route would be faster, but I'd like to avoid it if it's overkill.",2013-09-16 01:13:26

I'm trying to make myself a plan to learn theory for audio processing.
As a result, I want to be able to program some audio effects or virtual instrument stuff in a form of VST plugin (I saw frameworks like JUCE which can help with UI/API plugin stuff and focus on implementation) or external addons (not patches) to the PD/Max.

I'm a programmer myself (not yet related to audio processing though), so I don't really need an introduction to stuff like how to start programming. 

There are plenty of interesting books, but many of them are heavily biased on some topic.
For example, there is https://www.amazon.com/Audio-Programming-Book-MIT-Press/dp/0262014467, which looks interesting but providing all examples in the form of C programs, 
which I don't really want to use. They are not like pseudocode examples but complete implementations which are not useful form to provide theory stuff. 

This one also looks interesting http://msp.ucsd.edu/techniques.htm, but I'm wondering if the explained theory will be useful for understanding how to implement it, not only in the form of PD patches.

I found many recommendations for this book http://www.dspguide.com/, but it is not really audio-related. Maybe it is an advantage to grasp some math before doing audio-specific stuff? Is information in this book heavily-related to the audio processing routines?

So, should I start with http://www.dspguide.com/ and take something audio-related after/in parallel, or maybe there are some other books or resources?",2019-08-08 02:04:09

What does a normal cepstrum look like?,10,bn2ai0,https://www.reddit.com/r/DSP/comments/bn2ai0/what_does_a_normal_cepstrum_look_like/,4,1557543724.0,"I'm doing some work on speech processing - specifically, speech detection - and I'm trying to build some intuition of how cepstrum is used for speech detection. (Before you ask - some of my coworkers have - yes, it's ""cepstrum"", not a misspelled ""spectrum"". Great primer on Wikipedia:  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cepstrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cepstrum) )

I've read a few slide decks and research papers on cepstrum analysis for speech, and the example cepstrums show a nice spike in the magnitude of the quefrency as a signal that could indicate speech. Something like this:  [https://imgur.com/a/ffQcnu0](https://imgur.com/a/ffQcnu0)

However, my own work in building a cepstrum based detector doesn't show anything nearly so pronounced - at least, not beyond the zeroth term.

An input signal like this: [https://imgur.com/a/ItPRUrw](https://imgur.com/a/ItPRUrw)

Ends up yielding a cepstrum like this:  [https://imgur.com/a/DeG4VqF](https://imgur.com/a/DeG4VqF)

I do note, that, compared to a silent signal, I see a much bigger delta in the magnitude of the zero'th quefrency - this image shows a magnitude of \~12, where it's typically a magnitude of \~8 when silent:  [https://imgur.com/a/Oqoxokp](https://imgur.com/a/Oqoxokp)

I find myself with a lot of questions about the results I'm getting, and whether I understand each stage correctly?

* Taking the log() of the initial FFT appears to shift the bulk of the information into the real coefficients of the FFT. The imaginary coefficients appear to fall in the range of (-pi/2) < theta < (pi/2). That seems correct to me given what I know about taking the log of a complex number - is that what I'd expect?
* Am I perhaps not wrapping the phase term of the FFT correctly? Should the imaginary term be adjusting phase in one direction instead of two? e.g. ( 0 ) < theta < pi instead of (-pi/2) < theta < (pi/2)

&#x200B;

I am looking for a freelance DSP Engineer, Programmer or Computer Scientist who is experienced developing audio software for a patent-pending mobile app I am trying to build. I want to consult with someone about the feasibility of the project, best practices, and a path by which to move forward toward development. Of course, I'm happy to pay for an initial consult with someone with the right background and experience, but my preference would be to start working with someone who can develop a basic proof of concept. This could be a fun side-project (paid), and I'm also willing to share academic/professional credit when the final patent application is submitted. 

&#x200B;

I've posted a more detailed description for this project here: [https://innerjam.app/hiring-dsp-engineer/](https://innerjam.app/hiring-dsp-engineer/)

&#x200B;

In short, the core function of the app is to take any digital music track (or audio stream) and mix in a spoken vocal track so that the voice track plays *just below* the threshold of the listener's perception and does not adversely affect the music listening experience. I believe that the app will need to continuously measure the volume level of the music track and adjust the volume level of the voice track in real time or with ultra-low latency, but you may have different ideas to come up with the same result.

&#x200B;

**tl;dr:** The goal is to allow the user to listen to subliminal affirmations alongside their own choice of music or music stream.

&#x200B;

I'm interested in your opinions about whether this sort of functionality is possible to develop and whether newer mobile phones will be capable of the processing power necessary. How much time would you estimate a very simple proof-of-concept take to build (on either mobile or desktop) and what programming languages or tools are best suited?

&#x200B;

I am a (mostly) non-technical cofounder in way over my head as it relates to audio processing, the jargon involved, and this level of programming sophistication. I appreciate your patience and any helpful technical guidance you can offer. If this is not the best subreddit for my post, I'm open to suggestions.

&#x200B;

Thank you all for your help, thoughts, and interest in this challenge.

From my understanding FPGA can be used for some DSP work effectively, but real dedicated DSP's are better suited for more complex DSP work.  I have a personal interest in Virtual Analog Synthesis.

does anyone have experience with codec design?
What I know so far is that you can reduce data based on redundant signal content (example: psychophysics), assumptions about the source (example: speech synthesis or other modelling methods), stochastic prediction methods (RELP, CELP) and also the coding of information itself - which is not really part of ""regular"" signal processing imo but has more to do with information theory and low level software optimization. (Correct me if you disagree somewhere).

I've been looking at alot of audio codecs and while some are easier to understand (like MP3) others just blow my mind (like Opus).

Assume I have a known set of requirements like bandwidth, latency and the available bitrate - is it feasible to construct an algorithm from ground up? I know this is highly dependent on user testing too but let's say your subjective quality assessment is enough for a start before conducting a pilote study.

I feel a bit lost in this domain. Can anyone share experiences?",2018-12-07 21:08:32

First time posting here so I hope this post is fine.

I am interested in DSP, especially for audio but am not sure if I'm ready to get some real DSPs. Here's what I've gotten to work so far in VSTs (all C++):

- Fairly complex distortion device
- Oversampling (upsampling + interpolation)
- Parametric EQ
- Butterworth and Chebyshev Type 1 filters (did everything myself, location of poles/zeros and BLT, currently working on implementing the other filter types)
- Basic stuff like gain knob, panning etc.

What I have not yet done but think might be required:

- FFT (there are many libraries but my attempt at coding my own failed)
- Coding in assembly
- Soldering (a friend of mine might be able to do that part)

Do you think I could get away with getting  a Sharc Evaluation Kit and experimenting? I know, it's a lot of money but as far as I understand the evaluation kit is just required for programming and not for final products - and I would have a lot of performance to do more ressource-heavy tasks.

In my head, my dream software looks like this:

1. I have a visual interface with custom modules as ""blocks"" and patch cables routing them together in different ways.
2. Each module has various inputs and outputs, which can be connected in various ways using the patch.
3. Each module is literally just code, in some language, that takes the latest sample from each input channel, processes them in some custom way, and then comes up with a single sample to route to each output.
4. There is some way for modules to have internal state, or store buffers, or at least see previous inputs/outputs to some degree.
5. For example, a ring modulator module would multiply two input samples together and send to output. A realtime convolution module would have a difference equation that adds some linear combinations of past inputs and outputs. An instantaneous nonlinearity would be one line of code, and look something like `out = arctan(in)`. And so on, for dynamic convolution, Volterra series, or whatever.
6. More complex modules can be built up from chaining together simpler modules like these.

When I was in school, there were a bunch of DSP synth environments (Max, PureData, CSound, SuperCollider, Chuck, etc), each with different pros/cons. Which of them is closest to this direction? (And preferably, still being maintained?)",2018-03-10 21:22:16

For audio, this will sound like filtered noise.

I  could generate this by creating a white noise source, then filtering with a low/high/band/notch filter to move the output around but that is CPU intensive. I was wondering if there's a way to vary the parameters of the PRNG to limit and move the band of the output around.

I achieved this by randomly applying a random bit mask to the output of an PRNG, and then using that as the frequency word for a direct digital synthesizer, and I could also vary the waveform of the DDS.  The result is something that sounds like a distorted voice going over a radio.

I'm feeding in a mixed signal sin(2*pi*80*t)+sin(2*pi*175*t) which is generated by one of the boards to the the other board which is running the IIR filter program.

"EE undergrad looking for the ""best"" journey to learn DSP",10,1mdxmp,https://www.reddit.com/r/DSP/comments/1mdxmp/ee_undergrad_looking_for_the_best_journey_to/,5,1379210270.0,"First of all sorry for my english, it isn't my mother tongue. 

I'm an EE undergrad, starting my 3rd year. Since I am in a COOP program my program takes 4 and a third years to complete, which means I still have 2 1/3 years left.

My University's program is quite unique, and the ""courses"" are actually given in intensive 2 weeks covering a certain skillset. Every 2 weeks we are given a problem to solve (to be validated/graded on the 2nd week), and on the friday of the 2nd week we have an exam covering the stuff that was seen in these two weeks. While this is an awesome way to learn practical stuff since we get to read on the theory and directly get to apply it, I find this approach to be lacking when it comes to getting a solid, theoretical grasp on any given subject. 

For this reason, I would like to start learning DSP in a more formal way since I plan to go to grad school after my bachelor's degree. 

I love mathematics, but I wouldn't say I'm particularly gifted at maths. I've always done extremely well in my math courses but I attribute that to my work ethic and my passion for the subject. Also, my memory tends to work best when I understand something on a conceptual level. I hate using tools (such as mathematical equations) without a minimal understanding of why they work, and where they come from. 


I was considering starting by reading Lyons ""Understanding Digital Signal Processing"". From what I've been told the book uses as little math as possible, but try to makes the theory as intuitive as possible. According to some forum posts and amazon reviews, some professionnals in the DSP world didn't ""get"" certain concepts until they've read that book, although that didn't stop them from applying the concepts before that. I would like to know if it's a good idea to start my journey by reading Lyon's book before venturing into mathematic-heavy, and more rigorous ones (Oppenheim, Proakis, etc.). 

I'm mostly wondering if it would be better to go the Lyons -> Proakis or Proakis -> Lyons way. Does the order even matter at all? Am I right to believe both book ""types"" (intuitive VS mathematically rigorous) complement themselves well?",2013-09-14 20:57:50

Hi all, 

So over time while at work, I have come up with some techniques to try and solve certain problems, etc. They are nothing earth-shattering, but (I think) quite useful and unique in their own way, and that being said, they would sort of straddle DSP, Machine Learning, maybe statistical analysis too, etc.

At the same time, I never really had the chance to publish papers while in undergrad or grad school, (I have some from conferences), but nothing from while at academia. 

I read IEEE papers often and so I kinda know the 'jist' of them. 

I would like to build up my 'papers-published' resume, and I figured why not do it this way, but I have a couple questions:

* First of all, I would not be associated with academia at all, it would be purely 'me myself and I', although I suppose I would do it under the company I work for. Is this a problem?

* Having read a lot of IEEE papers, I notice some really good, some just terrible, some are easy reads, some might as well have been written on Omicron Prime, etc. I also tend to find a lot of plagiarism. Either-way, I basically tend to find a lot of different types of papers, but still, is there some 'common denominator' I should aim for when writing it? Do I have a fighting chance? Just what is the criteria for publishing? I should actually ask - what is the *effective* criteria for publishing, since I see many different kinds of papers on there. 

* This is also weird but - where *exactly* do I ""go"" and submit a paper to? Which site(s)? I am somewhat confused by IEEE, journals, transactions, blah blah blah, so who/where do I submit a paper to?

  * Is there a limit to how many times you can submit a paper?
  * What criteria are used to determine if you can publish? 

So many more questions, anyway, thanks to any insights you can give me in advance! ",2012-03-23 02:05:18

I began messing around with ""DSP/music"" programs like Max/MSP and Pure Data when I was 16, and since then I have become somewhat disillusioned with the interpreted, drag-and-drop, high-level ""programming languages.""

I have spent the last few years writing my own primitive signal processing functions and libraries in C/C++. I understand the N^2 version of the DFT, and I am working on the FFT. I have a working, if limited electronics background. Simple digital/analog lowpass/highpass filters make sense to me, and I understand how they relate to integrals/derivatives.

However, my math background is fragmented. I am currently struggling to pass Calculus II because I have since forgotten all of the rules I was supposed to have memorized in Calculus I. I am a rather hands-on individual, and ""plugging and chugging"" numbers is not something I have ever been particularly good at.

I really need to understand a concept at the most fundamental level for it to ""click"" with me, and much of DSP literature seems to involve nigh-endless strings of impenetrable formulas. The information does not seem to be nearly as complex as the obscure syntax and notational shortcuts used to describe it, but it would seem that the only way to learn to decipher these glyphs is to change majors from comp sci to EE.

**Now:**

I am currently designing my own music software, and I would like to be able to say that I wrote all of my signal processing from scratch. (so far, I have) Digital filter design is something I have desperately wanted to learn for a long time, but it seems impossible. BiQuad filters, the Z-Transform, the Sync function; it's all nonsense to me. I suppose that I could use the Fourier transform for all my frequency-domain-related needs, but it is an algorithm with limited practical use where audio is concerned.

I know how to use filters, I can build the simplest ones, and I could probably write code that executes the more complex ones using a ""cookbook,"" but that's not what I want to do. I want to have the ability to design a lowpass filter with the characteristics that *I* want, and I want to understand exactly how/why it works.

I see filter design as one of the (very) few parts of digital music software that I have yet to conquer, and as someone who would like to work in the music software/hardware design industry it is a skill that would be useful to have.

I have had surprisingly few opportunities to speak with knowledgeable minds about my quest to understand filter design, and I am hoping that /r/DSP can help set me on the right path.",2011-05-09 04:14:53

I want to find the frequency of this ~~tone~~ complex exponential. The deleted zones are periodic; and the data is uniformly sampled.

As an example:

I  have a million sample points, split into 1000 consecutive frames of a 1000 samples each. Only the first 10 samples of each frame still exist, the rest have been zero'd out.

The ~~tone~~ complex exponential in the data is very slow -- too slow for a 1000 point FFT to accurately catch it. So I need to use multiple frames per FFT, but the zero'd out data gives the FFT a strange response. It's almost like zero-padding but not quite because it's inbetween data instead of appended.

The zero'ing out of the data results in a comb-like FFT output.

The best results I've gotten so far have been by averaging FFTs that span multiple frames, and are also zero-padded. Applying MUSIC has also worked well.

My questions:

1. Is there a term for this 'nulling' of data (zero-padding is obviously not it).
2. How can I determine the actual resolution I am getting (since the data points are so sparse).
3. Any other ideas/approaches?

\----------------------------------------

Edit. So I now understand why I get the comb-like effect. The periodic zero'ing out of the data is essentially multiplying my signal by a rectangular window convolved with a dirac-comb at the frame period (expressed below).

  `𝑥 x (rect_window * III) => X * (sinc x III)`

Now because my signal is a complex exponential, the frequency domain becomes a sync-dirac-comb centered at the complex exponential's frequency. I think I can do better by choosing a different window.",2019-08-07 12:11:35

I'd like your comments on and critiques of my plan to resynthesize audio from granules of sound from a large corpus.,10,bgw4og,https://www.reddit.com/r/DSP/comments/bgw4og/id_like_your_comments_on_and_critiques_of_my_plan/,19,1556149249.0,"Hello!  I'm about to start work on a new audio composition, but the computation time to do it is sufficiently large that I really need to plan it out in a disciplined fashion.

So I wanted to bounce it off you guys.

PREMISE

I have a corpus of over half a million seconds/400 hours of audio in over 30k documents of length varying from a few seconds to half an hour.

My plan is to divide this into a large number of short granules and measure some feature set for each granule.

Then, given a source audio input file, I divide it into granules and replace each by the nearest granule from the corpus, to get a resynthesized version of the source, using the sounds of the corpus.  

---

WHAT I DO AND DO NOT UNDERSTAND

Actually doing the large parallel computation is something I understand.

I know that sharp-edged granules would sound terrible, and I won't do that.  I know how to do all sorts of fades nicely in memory (I use numpy for this purpose).

I think I understand that having a fixed granule size is a bad idea from previous experience in this sort of thing.  

So my plan is to have the granule size for a sample of length S in seconds be `K * log(S)` for some constant K (K being somewhere very roughly around 200ms).

My question is really the feature extraction - what features do I extract from each granule to make it somewhat recognizable, while not breaking the bank computationally?

My tentative plan is, per granule

1. Perform an FFT (or a mel frequency cepstrum calculation or some similar frequency domain calculation - right now it's looking like a discrete cosine transform) that gives me N bands
2. Store each of the P most energetic bands and their levels (""the pitch"")
3. Store a summary of the remaining N - P bands compactly as some distribution (""the noise"")
4. Get _two_ granules from the corpus:
  1. The ""pitch granule"" which is closest in pitch
  2. The ""noise granule"" which is closest to the noise distribution
5. Mix them according to the relative levels from 2 and 3.
6. ~~Profit!~~ Resynthesis!

Given that it's an art piece, where considerable lack of fidelity might even be desirable, I'm probably going to start with just the pitch, and add the noise later as it becomes necessary.

I would add that I still haven't resolved what ""closest"" means exactly, either for the pitch granule or the noise granule.

I have written code and verified that it works, I was just hoping that this community might be able to give some pointers on how to improve on the code - best practices, efficiency, etc.
I designed the filter and obtained the coefficients in Python. The C++ code is merely an implementation of the filter itself. 

[Here](https://github.com/engrstudent1/notchFilterCplusplus) is the code (I have the actual code split into three files - main, iirFilter.h, and iirFilter.cpp, but for demonstration purposes on this site I just combined it into a single file). Also included are the coefficient files and the input/ouput files. I structured the C++ code such that it is reading in a file containing the filter coefficients rather than just hard-coding them in, to eventually test various filter orders.


I am planning on documenting all of this, including the design process and corresponding Python code, in a Jupyter notebook to put into this repo soon, but I was hoping for some tips on how to improve my C++ code first.

Why do we use Wavelets instead of just iterating the Short Time Fourier Transform with different window sizes?,11,50xnh6,https://www.reddit.com/r/DSP/comments/50xnh6/why_do_we_use_wavelets_instead_of_just_iterating/,16,1472912547.0,"Hi there,

I've recently been studying Wavelets and have been learning about their application to analyzing time-frequency characteristics of a signal.

One thing that keeps coming up is their benefit in being able to adapt to time and frequency resolution appropriately. Essentially, when we're trying to identify high frequencies, we can use a compact wavelet such that we have adequate time localization with appropriate frequency resolution. And when we're trying to identify low frequency components, we can use a stretched wavelet such that we have higher frequency resolution at the cost of decreased time localization. This seems to make sense.

However, I keep hearing reference regarding superiority of Wavelets to the short-time fourier transform (stft) in the sense that the stft is constrained to a fix frequency resolution while the wavelet is capable of adapting. 

This confuses me. I mean, what exactly is stopping us from repeating the stft using different window sizes? Could we not just iterating the stft with a few different window sizes, and then generate a time-frequency coefficient plot using the results from each iteration? As in, we would calculate the high frequency coefficients using a small stft window with good time resolution, and then use a large sftf window for low frequencies at the cost of decreased time localization? It seems like this would yield the same exact information produced by a wavelet transform... Why do I keep hearing bad stuff about the stft?

The only benefit I can think of using the wavelet transform is that it couples the 'scale' and 'window width' into a single variable such that you can do one transform, instead of being required to do multiple transforms of the stft in the procedure I described above..

Anyways, I would appreciate any information on this topic! Thanks",2016-09-03 09:22:27

So I think the inputs to an FFT are a list of values, ordered by time and those values are the amplitude of the observed wave. And the outputs are a list of values, ordered by frequency and those values are also the amplitude.

Assuming that's correct, I had thought I could do an FFT on the samples of a song and then simply 0 out the values of the frequencies outside my filter. Then IFFT that and I'd have the the song with the desired frequencies filtered out. But when I tried this, I just ended up with garbage. So I must be missing something. Yes, there are more elegant ways to do the filtering on the FFTd data, and I did try a Butterworth filter, but I still ended up with garbage.

Enter the problem of supporting different sampling rates, like 88.2 or 192 kHz. My foremost goal is to avoid any differences (like an altered phase response) depending on the used sampling rate.

Now am I correct in assuming that the IIR filters leave me no other option than **sample rate conversion**? (I went to some lengths trying to design equivalent - within tolerance - IIR filters at different sampling rates, but failed)

So I reluctantly went with the resampling approach, but now I'm porting the thing to less powerful hardware, so I need to lower the quality of the SR conversion, and I'm not happy about it.

So I was wondering... How is this generally handled in the industry? Do market leading audio plugins avoid the costly (and lossy) SR conversion, but instead allow for slightly different response due to different IIR designs for different sample rates?

Anyone got a minute for someone who has a very baseline understanding of all this?,8,1sh77e,https://www.reddit.com/r/DSP/comments/1sh77e/anyone_got_a_minute_for_someone_who_has_a_very/,7,1386641037.0,"Hello,

I want to preface this by letting you all know that I don't come from a DSP/EE/anything remotely close to that background.  I have a degree in French with a minor in IT.  That said I've been playing around with radio as a hobby for just under a year now and I do have a fair bit of familiarity with programming.

My question is, I've captured an [ASK/OOK signal](http://imgur.com/7EOGg1U) from an Arduino transmitter, cleaned it up into a [square wave](http://i.imgur.com/d63A5DC.png) using python as I felt it was easier to read.  Originally I was planning to count the highs/lows+pulse length by hand and translate the signal like that but that got to be somewhat messy.  

So I decided I would try to write a python script to go over the wav file and output a 1 or 0 or 11 or 00 depending on pulse length and amplitude (IE, HIGH-HIGH-LOW-HIGH-LOW-LOW-LOW-HIGH = 11010001). I have it reading and I get an array of sample values (8903 values I believe in total on a duration of 0.044s, I'll have to confirm when I jump on my home PC).

Since I have a known number of samples and a known pulse length, I was thinking I'd be able to write my own translator by testing 1 sample and stepping through @ x samples where x is the pulse length.

I have the guts of the program working (i.e. outputting 1/0 to a file) but I'm not sure whether I'm stepping through properly (read: have the correct pulse rate based on number of samples)

My questions are as follows:

1) Is my logic sound? Is what I'm proposing even feasible? Is there a better way to do this?  

2) On a sample rate of 192k, how much time does a single sample represent? How would I calculate this so that I could account for potentially different sampling rates?

3) Should I perhaps try and obtain a lower sample rate for the sake of making things a little easier calculation wise?

4) What the hell did I get myself into?

I will post more details when I'm home including the python script I'm trying to get going to do this all.

Fourier Transform VS. Wavelet Decomposition,9,114yep,https://www.reddit.com/r/DSP/comments/114yep/fourier_transform_vs_wavelet_decomposition/,7,1349733588.0,"I have signals that must undergo two transformations. First, I must calculate the mean power for each frequency ranging from 1 Hz to 50 Hz at an resolution of 1.0 Hz.  Secondly, I take specific 10 second intervals of my data (sampling rate = 250 i.e. each point corresponds to 4 ms of data) and collapse the mean power for each frequency across this range producing a single vector of length 50 (one for each frequency in the range 1 through 50).

My question should be fairly straightforward: given that I'm averaging over a 10 second period, essentially losing temporal information, does it make any difference whether I use wavelet decomposition or the Fourier transform?  I understand one of the benefits of performing the frequency decomposition using wavelets over Fourier transform is that you get increased temporal resolution.  But if I'm only interested in a single vector for this 10 second period, it seems that I don't need the extra temporal information gained by wavelet decomposition.

Question Regarding Frequency Identification using a Phase Vocoder and Autotune,8,e3zm3k,https://www.reddit.com/r/DSP/comments/e3zm3k/question_regarding_frequency_identification_using/,7,1575162405.0,"I'm attempting to use a phase vocoder for autotune in a school project I'm working on. Using the blog post here:  [http://blogs.zynaptiq.com/bernsee/pitch-shifting-using-the-ft/](http://blogs.zynaptiq.com/bernsee/pitch-shifting-using-the-ft/) and the accompanying code, I was able to implement the phase vocoder for a frame size of 1024 points with 75% overlap (sampling frequency is 48k Hz). The pitch shifting sounds pretty good, but I'm having some trouble getting autotune to work properly.

Steps I'm using to do autotune:

1. Identify the strongest frequency in the phase vocoder's analysis step using the calculated true frequencies and corresponding magnitude (let's call this maxFreq)
2. Using an array of pure notes (not sure if this is the correct terminology, the array is comprised of the frequencies corresponding to notes on an A440 scale with the sharp/flat notes removed) I identify the nearest note to maxFreq
3. I then calculate the scaling factor (let's call it tuningFactor) required to scale maxFreq to the nearest note
4. Next I average tuningFactor with the last N calculated tuningFactors from previous time frames (N is variable, basically this is just to allow for transitions between frequencies without it sounding robotic, for example, if N=20 it would require you to hold a note for \~50ms before it was fully corrected to the nearest note, this smooths the tuningFactor over time)
5. Using the average of current and previous tuningFactors, I scale the frequencies of the entire sample, go through the synthesis step and output sound after the inverse transform + windowing + overlap add

The result sounds okay, but when I debug the code I believe that the max frequency identification in the analysis step of the phase vocoder is incorrect. For example, if I input a 1k Hz sine wave, I would expect it to determine that maxFreq = \~1000Hz and correct to either (B5) 987.77 Hz or (C6) 1046.50 Hz, but it seems to determine that frequencies between 50 Hz and 250 Hz are the max frequency (it isn't consistent).

If I just take the magnitude of the FFT and pick the max value bin by bin I get roughly the right frequency (since the frequency resolution is 48000/1024 = 46.875 Hz/bin I don't get exactly 1000 Hz) but I believe this is inadequate for pitch correction since I'll be misidentifying the maxFreq of the input signal (if I determine that the maximum magnitude occurs in the 21st bin, that corresponds to 984.375 Hz at my FFT's frequency resolution which would give an erroneous tuningFactor value).

My question is whether the analysis step of the phase vocoder should give me the correct true frequency corresponding to the maximum magnitude (i.e. something near 1000 Hz) or if it cannot be used to identify the maximum frequency due to something I don't understand about the phase vocoder.

TL;DR: I'm trying to identify the strongest true frequency in the analysis step of the phase vocoder and I'm getting erroneous values. I can't use just the strongest frequency bin from the magnitude of the FFT because it isn't precise enough at my FFT's frequency resolution.

&#x200B;

EDIT: I fixed the frequency identification by replacing part of my code with a direct snippet of the example code from the aforementioned blog. 

I changed this

    //map dphi into -pi,pi
    if (dphi > M_PI)
        dphi -= 2*M_PI;
    else if (dphi < -M_PI)
        dphi += 2*M_PI;

to

    /* map delta phase into +/- Pi interval */
    qpd = dphi/M_PI;
    if (qpd >= 0) qpd += qpd&1;
    else qpd -= qpd&1;
    dphi -= M_PI*(float)qpd;

and it works properly. I thought I understood what this snippet was doing (since dphi can fall outside of -pi to pi after we manipulate it we need to map it back to -pi to pi) so I figured it was a weird way to add/subtract multiples of 2\*PI (since that won't affect our phase when we do the synthesis using sin/cos but it does affect our frequency calculations) but obviously that isn't what it's doing. Can anyone explain what the author is doing in the second snippet, especially what's up with the &1 parts?",2019-11-30 19:06:45

Method used by DAWs to draw wave forms,7,d9ke9l,https://www.reddit.com/r/DSP/comments/d9ke9l/method_used_by_daws_to_draw_wave_forms/,20,1569536929.0,"Hi, I'm creating an audio player primarily designed for the playback of sound effects in a sound board format.  I have my audio data contained in an array of signed 16-bit integers corresponding to each sample. 

I am now interested in finding the best way to draw this waveform to be displayed to and understood by the user. Since my app's target audience is more creators/artists that engineers the waveform will ideally be in a format familiar to said audience so I plan on using the same method that modern DAWs use to display. 

So my question is, do DAWs simply portray the integer values of the audio, or do they perhaps convert it into a different unit of measurement such as dB or dBu?

On a similar note, since there are so many samples in each sound effect, it seems pointless to use every single sample's amplitude to draw the waveform. Does it make sense to keep to a strict rule of only using every nth sample to use, or should I take 'n' samples and average them, using that figure instead?

Currently I am using a method where I take every 10th sample and draw a line from the center-point of the waveform to its amplitude (which can be positive or negative), leave a small gap and then draw for the subsequent sample:

Confused about SNR (plots inside!),7,bhmnnu,https://www.reddit.com/r/DSP/comments/bhmnnu/confused_about_snr_plots_inside/,18,1556316316.0,"I'm finding myself a bit confused about different ways to measure SNR.

&#x200B;

See Figure 1:  [https://imgur.com/a/FfyNURX](https://imgur.com/a/FfyNURX) 

&#x200B;

Imagine my signal power is a total of 10W, spread across 3 bins (so 3.33 W/bin). My noise power is also 10W total, and spans all 10 bins (so 1W/bin). It would seem then that there's two possible ways to calculate SNR - the ratio of the total power (10W / 10W), or the ratio of the per-bin (or displayed-level) power, (3.33/1).  Which of these (or neither?) are correct?

&#x200B;

However I think I realized the above isn't really correct at all, since bins 1 - 3 would contain energy from both the signal and noise. So, instead, I thought about it this way:

&#x200B;

See Figure 2:  [https://imgur.com/a/dmmlQWq](https://imgur.com/a/dmmlQWq) 

&#x200B;

Again, my signal and noise are both 10W total power, but as they both ""fill"" the first 3 bins, the power here is now 4.33 W/bin. In this case, summing the spectrum yields 20W as expected. But again, it seems to present another set of numbers for calculating the SNR (see equations 3 & 4)!

&#x200B;

So yeah, I'm confused about how to think of all this properly.

The Optimal Causal FIR Wiener Filter,10,bdec4k,https://www.reddit.com/r/DSP/comments/bdec4k/the_optimal_causal_fir_wiener_filter/,12,1555352383.0,"Hi everyone. I'm looking to get some feedback on a post I created about the Wiener filter. In the post, I go over a short derivation for the casual Wiener filter, provide a brief overview of its applications, and supply practice problems. Specifically, I'd like to know if I went into enough detail and made it easy enough to understand that an engineer could read the post and create a Wiener filter for their own applications. What else do you think I should add to make the post better?

Help understanding Hilbert Transform,9,aba1jc,https://www.reddit.com/r/DSP/comments/aba1jc/help_understanding_hilbert_transform/,7,1546311425.0,"I have a stream of ADC data coming into an FPGA from two sources that are receiving modulation at 2 frequencies each. Id like to know the phase difference between the two on sources of one of the frequencies. 


Ive read that the Hilbert transform can tell you phase information, and also that it can be implemented in an FIR filter, so I was thinking I could combine that with a lowpass filter to get just the phase of the frequency Im interested in from both adcs and compare them.

However Im not really clear in how the Hilbert works.

In Matlab I tried making 2 signals, one is cos(2*pi*f1*t), and one is cos(2*pi*f1*t + pi/3).

My understanding of the hilbert is that its multiplying all negative frequency conponents by i and positive components by -i, so I made a vector h =[ 0 -sqrt(-1)*ones(1,500) sqrt(-1)*ones(1,500)]

Then I tried hs1 = ifft(h.*fft(s1))

Which I thought would be the hilbert transform of s1. What I get is another sine wave, but Im not really clear on what the difference is between the two. Can someone clarify what exactly the significance of the output signal is, and also confirm whether I did the transform correctly?

Edit: I found out that Matlab actually has a ""hilbert"" function, and what it seems like its doing is multiplying all the positive frequencies by 2 and all the negative frequencies by 0. Does that sound more like whats supposed to happen? The output is what looks like IQ data, so it seems useful, I just dont quite understand why thats how the function is set up.",2018-12-31 20:57:05

I want to extract features from these files using fft, but the uneven spaced values are making this impossible.

For some reason the gyroscope data does look acceptable (I assume). In the following table there's some values I've gotten when I used the matlab command mean(diff(timestamp-colum)) on some of these files and the result is that the gyroscope has on average the lowest rate of invariate (correct term?!) data.

What is the connection between these saturation curves and the harmonic profile? Why does increasing asymmetry in wave shapes lead to more even harmonics? Why does a square wave cause only odd harmonics? Is it even possible to get a ballpark idea of harmonics by looking at the gain curve, or is the calculation too convoluted and tedious?

As all of you know, we adore Gaussian functions due to their well-concentration on both time and frequency domain. Also, their differentians and Fourier Transform's also again Gaussian. That means, their shapes predictable and gain importance in non-linear systems and transforms that have redundancy like wavelets. 

My question is, can we say Gaussian is also important because we can achieve optimum time-frequency resolution product when we use Gaussians? Am I wrong, or do I misunderstood the concept? Besides, do you have any extra info about Gaussians?

I'm normally not in this field at all, so I hope one of you wil recognise this. 

I inherited some old code that does some pretty heavy filtering on digital samples from a sensor. I re-built it in Excel to see what it looks like. It looks like this. Blue is unfiltered, orange is filtered: https://i.imgur.com/BLZMhuj.png

The formula used is the following. I use f for the filtered value, u for the unfiltered measurement, and U1, U2, U3, F2, F3 as constants that I obtained from the program.

    f_0 =   F2 * f_{-1} 
    	  + F3 * f_{-2} 
    	  + U1 * u_0 
    	  + U2 * u_{-1}

    U1	0.000944692
    U2	0.001889384
    U3	0.000944692

Note that U1 = U3 and U2 = 2U1

It seems to look at both the unfiltered values 3 ticks in the past as well as the filtered values 3 ticks in the past. The constants sum to 1.

This variation can drift over time because of temperature or whatever, so I cant just measure every DAC possibility at the start and remember the optimal value, I need a way to quickly determine the adjustment needed in a short time frame.

In addition, because of noise on the ADC, I cant necessarily just increment the DAC by 1 and see if the ADC raises, because if it raises or lowers that might just be to random noise fluctuation.

Feature extraction for the voltage signal of a 4-cylinder engine starting?,10,69ikss,https://www.reddit.com/r/DSP/comments/69ikss/feature_extraction_for_the_voltage_signal_of_a/,4,1494061659.0,"I'll try to make this short and sweet. I'm doing a project at uni where in I am trying to estimate the health of an engine by monitoring the voltage drop/draw of the starter motor during the start-up proceedure... The general idea behind it is that if a cylinder has a loss of compression, the starter motor will be able to crank easier during that part of the cycle and in turn, requiring less voltage to do so.

My question is how do I go about the Feature extraction process for this?

I have provided some of the basic plots of the data I've got to try to explain what I need to do... Bearing in mind I'm almost a complete novice when it comes to Machine Learning Algorithms etc.

The link for the album is here: http://imgur.com/a/wtSSs


As I said before, I need to somehow evaluate how the maximum voltage draw changes over each crank, and I'm guessing in this sense it is also necessary to label each cylinder too. How do I go about this?

There are also a lot of small things to conisder suchas how the initial crank is always a lot lower than the ones that follow. Also, I apologise if this sounds confusing. It makes sense in my head but is a pain to explain! If more info is needed I will happily provide it.

Thanks!

P.S. The main study for the project is primarily the battery voltage over the cranking cycle and is intended to be as non-intrusive as possible.",2017-05-06 04:07:39

Phase discontinuity leading to interesting frequency spectrum lobing... Any explanations?,9,517qxb,https://www.reddit.com/r/DSP/comments/517qxb/phase_discontinuity_leading_to_interesting/,5,1473078153.0,"Hi there,

I've recently been doing some hobby research into time-frequency signal analysis and have come across the concept of time-scale modifications (TSM - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_time-scale/pitch_modification). The part that really intrigued me was the problem of changing the time scale while minimizing a change in frequency content of the signal. Essentially, try to find a method to change the signal duration without increasing or decreasing the overall frequency content.

Several methods for achieving this implement the Short Time Fourier Transform (STFT) which calls for calculating frames and changing their time locations. However, this relocation of time frames can introduce problems such as phase discontinuity. Now the idea of phase discontinuity was something that seemed to make sense, but it wasn't something that I had ever really examined. So I fixed that and discovered some interesting results. 

Referring to my MATLAB script [here](https://github.com/teaguehall/MATLAB/blob/master/Scripts/phasediscontinuity.m), I created two signals: the first being a plain sinusoid with frequency of 400 Hz and the second being a signal made up of segments of the original signal, but with an added phase shift to each segment. Thus the second signal is essentially a 400 Hz sinusoid with multiple phase discontinuities. 

I was originally interested in the audio effects of phase discontinuity, and the results did indeed verify that there is noticeable distortion introduced. 

I then decided to take a look at the frequency content of this new signal ([here](http://imgur.com/a/w32YQ)) and saw something interesting. As expected, the peak frequency was indeed 400 Hz, however, there appears to be lobing as the you travel away from the peak frequency. This is interesting as I assumed adding random discontinuities would have added random frequencies to the spectrum. After further thought however, I decided that it made sense that the frequency content would tend towards the peak frequency since I'm limiting the amount of discontinuity.

However, I'm still not sure why the lobing exists. Is this some type of well known phenomenon? How do I actually know these frequencies aren't being aliased? The spacing of the lobes appear to be directly dependent on the number of discontinuities introduced into the signal. A small number of discontinuities results in small spacing, while a large number of discontinuities results in large spacing.

Any thoughts on this?",2016-09-05 07:22:33

The mystery of the 4 tracks of audio interleaved into one audio file,9,2xkpel,https://www.reddit.com/r/DSP/comments/2xkpel/the_mystery_of_the_4_tracks_of_audio_interleaved/,2,1425258765.0,"Someone (who feels really really bad about it) formatted an SD card from a Zoom H6 and we lost some important audio files. Original recording format was 4 tracks of 96kHz, 24 bit mono.

Since nothing was ever written to the card after it was formatted, we were able to recover the files using Recuva, but the rescued .wavs show some unusual properties.

**Now at this point I should say that I'm really just trying to recover the audio for curiosity's sake. So if you're interested read on........** 

Here's what I've figured out so far....

When you import one of the recovered .wavs into audacity or audition the data is all there, but it is punctuated by regular bursts of static in blocks of exactly 21840 samples like so:

[audio][static][audio][static][audio][static][etc...]

This is the same whether you import as a .wav or as raw data, as stereo or as mono, or even if you change the bits per sample using HeaderInvestigator.exe. 

If you remove the static blocks by hand the audio data reveals an odd echo effect that goes away if you again delete every other block. Barring my sloppy cuts, the audio stream is now restored.

With this in mind, I inspected the file in a hex editor and searched for the .wav headers to find four identical instances spread out in the file. Looking then for the ""data"" flag, I found it four times at offsets of 32760, 65528, 98296 and 131064.

This leads me to believe that the audio can be recovered by pushing it through a processing tool to remove blocks of X samples starting at N offset. Unfortunately my coding skills are limited to windows batch files (the horror!) so I'm turning to /r/DSP for help... Is there a tool that could help untangle this wav file?

Sample:

[Slow internet here. Will upload when I have access to something better]

I made this sample by importing 10% of the original .wav into audacity as raw data (24 bit signed little endian mono) and then exported a copy as a header-less 24 bit PCM. I then verified that they are an exact match in wxHexEditor.",2015-03-01 19:12:45
Why does zero-padding before a DFT lead to interpolation?,10,2wlld1,https://www.reddit.com/r/DSP/comments/2wlld1/why_does_zeropadding_before_a_dft_lead_to/,10,1424502346.0,"Hi all!

I am trying to understand the effect of zero-padding a finite signal in the time domain before performing a DFT. I know this results in interpolation in the frequency domain (I can see it when plotting graphs, and examples are all over the internet), but I don't understand *why* interpolation happens.

Specifically, if I look at a [formula](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_Fourier_transform#Definition) for the DFT, I see that every term in the summation includes the factor x_n. If I zero-pad my signal x at the right, I would expect the last few x_n to be zero, and therefore these terms shouldn't contribute to the sum. But apparently it does. As an example, I [plotted the FFT](http://imgur.com/nZInOw0) of the signal x=[1 0 0.5] with and without zero-padding. How can there still be 15 terms (crosses in the graph) left after the FFT, none of which are zero? Looking at the formula, I would have expected the third graph (that I manually inserted in there to illustrate this).

Any insight into the DFT is appreciated, even if it doesn't answer this question, because I do not think I understand it at all, and I'd like to!",2015-02-21 01:05:46

For a project, I'm trying to understand using cross correlation to reduce noise in measurements. As I understand it, it I simultaneously measure some signal through two separate ADC's, the noise added by the ADC's (and whatever other duplicated circuitry) will cancel out with cross correlation.

What I've managed to get from various google searches is simply

1. Make two separate measurements, at the same time
2. Apply some window-functions to the series, Fourier transform each set of samples
3. Multiply one (complex valued) transform with the complex conjugate of the other
4. absolute values squared gives the power spectrum, with reduced noise.

However, when I try to simulate this in software, the resulting spectrum after the multiplication is (predictably enough) no longer ""correct"", in the sense that the amplitudes at various (non noise) frequencies are much higher than in the original signal! So I assume I am missing a step for normalizing the values somewhere. Any hints?

My little program simply creates 1024 samples of two sinewaves. Then, add random noise to two copies of the signal. These are my ""measurements"", which are windowed with the Hann window function, before Fourier transform.

I understand Lanczos resampling from a theoretical math perspective - what I'm attempting to understand is this FPGA implementation.

From reading the code, it looks like a connected processor generates a ""coefficient matrix"" which is really just a table that contains discrete values of a given Lanczos kernel.  (I'll talk about just the horizontal scaler, as the vertical scaler is identical, just using different incoming pixels)  The scaler has 7 taps (or samples, or pixels) from the incoming line, and has 64 ""phases"".  The coefficient matrix ends up being 7x64, or 64 coefficients for each tap.  The logic ""walks"" through this list, multiplying the 7 coefficients by the 7 tap pixels and summing the result to get the output pixel.

Now, here's what I don't understand: the code that generates this matrix *doesn't take into account the scale factor*.  Instead, which coefficients used for each step is determined by a counter which *is* based on the scale factor.  For instance, at a given scale factor, the logic uses every 3rd coefficient, but a different scale factor might use every 7th coefficient.

First I have to tell you that I'm in no way a specialist in signal processing neither in the physic and mathematical stuff behind it. I'm a little familiar with the principal of Fourrier analysis but that's all. I want to ask you several question:

- if I understood correctly, we can estimate the contribution of several frequencies in a signal by computing a FFT. What I have difficulties to understand is the notion and unit of power : when you see a spectrogram, what are the colors on this spectrogram really represents? The power by hertz? Could you give me a simple explanation for me to better understand what is a power?

- in several spectrogram I saw, people transform the frequency in the log10 of the frequency and then plot the power/decade. I don't really understand this unit. Any help there could also be greatly appreciated.

So, I'm working on an audio project. I have a software implementation running in my own host app on linux/x86 and in VST on windows/x64. I want to patent what I've built before I go public with it, but I'd like to do it in both a software and hardware implementation, as my eventual goal is to sell VST plugins and, separately, hardware boxes.

I think I know enough about building circuits w/ IC chips to get this working. What I don't know regarding circuitry, I have books on. My problem is industrial: How does one get started building hardware w/ dedicated DSP chips? This specific topic isn't covered in great detail where I've looked.

To start, is there a breadboard dev kit I can buy? Does the breadboard have everything I need to flash firmware? Do I need a separate arm or pic processor, or is the dev kit and dsp chip enough to support DAC, ADC, my dsp, and a few knobs? 

Most of my work is in c++, but the core tech was (very deliberately) done in c. Does ansi c matter when you're dealing with dedicated dsp chip apis or assembly? What compilers and language are supported? Is gcc appropriate?

Is a breadboard implementation enough for a patent? I suspect it's not. Where does one go with a circuit schematic and start getting boards pressed? This is where it gets really expensive.

Mutation testing, in particular, can be helpful in determining the ability of a test suite to find defects in code. Because of challenges incurred developing on complex embedded systems, test suite evaluation on these systems is very difficult and costly. We developed and implemented a tool called DynaMut to insert conditional mutations into the software under test for embedded applications. We then demonstrate how the tool can be used to automate the collection of data using an existing proprietary embedded test suite in a runtime testing environment. Conditional mutation is used to reduce the time and effort needed to perform test quality evaluation in 48% to 67% less time than it would take to perform the testing with a more traditional mutate-compile-test methodology. We also analyze if testing time can be further reduced while maintaining quality by sampling the mutations tested.

Question: does anyone have any examples of combining ordered dithering with error diffusion?,7,e50pnm,https://www.reddit.com/r/DSP/comments/e50pnm/question_does_anyone_have_any_examples_of/,10,1575329901.0,"Hi, I hope this is the appropriate subreddit to ask this - dithering is kind of a part of DSP, right?

I'm a programmer working mostly with front-end data-visualization and without any DSP background. I do have an interest in how dithering algorithms work in the context of image processing. So I had a realization the other day:

1. [Ordered dithering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordered_dithering) works by varying the threshold for rounding based on the location of the pixel
2. [Error-diffusion dithering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_diffusion) works by diffusing rounding error that follows after rounding
3. *It should be trivial to compose these approaches*. Vary the rounding threshold per pixel, and diffuse the rounding error. It should just ""stack"".

So I tried it out, and the results are kind of interesting (I think). You can see for yourself here:

https://observablehq.com/@jobleonard/ordered-error-diffusion-dithering

So then I decided to look for prior art, and I cannot find any. There's material on classic error diffusion algorithms, on ordered dithering matrices and how to create them, but I cannot find any examples of ""hybrid dithering"" where the two are combined.

Has this really not been done before? And in the more likely case that it has, does anyone have links to more information, because I'm really curious what else has been tried and found out! Because it is immediately obvious from this little experiment that the interaction between ordered and error-diffusion dithering has some surprising emergent results, and I'm sure there is some interesting deeper insights one could find out about it.

What does it mean to add Gaussian Noise to a signal?,7,dzdt16,https://www.reddit.com/r/DSP/comments/dzdt16/what_does_it_mean_to_add_gaussian_noise_to_a/,12,1574338492.0,"I haven't delved into statistical signals processing at all so please be patient with me if this is a rudimentary question. I've heard the phrase ""adding noise to a signal/noisy signal"" thrown around a lot but never really understood what it means in terms of signal value. There are two operations in particular that I typically come across: adding noise to a signal and removing noise from a signal. I don't know how either operations are done in practice, though that is what I'm trying to figure out. 

I'd like to take a shot at the former operation and describe what I think a noisy signal is. From statistics, I learned that a [probability distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_density_function) is a function that assign 'weights' to values (in the discrete sample space) or range of values (in the continuous sample space). The weights tell you how likely a value (or a value from an interval) will 'appear'/be 'selected'/'occur'/'observed' (in the sense that the side of a coin 'appears' or a red marble is 'selected' or the number of people are 'observed' in a time interval or a voltage value 'occurs' in a signal). 

Say you had a signal **x(**n**)** where 'n' is some number in the range n=0,1,...,N. Assume the noise has some probability distribution **D**(t), which can be Normal (Gaussian), Uniform, etc. but note that 't' is continuous. A noisy version of **x** can be obtained by taking the value that is 'observed', **D(**t**)** and adding it to **x(**n**)** for all possible values of 'n'.",2019-11-21 06:14:52

Methods for piecewise linear approximation / breakpoint fitting,6,dfgpcb,https://www.reddit.com/r/DSP/comments/dfgpcb/methods_for_piecewise_linear_approximation/,10,1570654870.0,"Hey /r/DSP 

I am looking for methods to do a linear piece-wise fit to decimate something like a signal or envelope. So the input of my desired function is a signal `x[n]` at sampling rate and the return can be pairs of *non-equally spaced* time and amplitude values that could later be linearly interpolated to ""restore"" an approximation on the original curve/signal shape. This is obviously a very lossy method, but it's close enough for my purpose. Spline interpolation not required.

In the audio realm a set of these time/amplitude values is often called ""breakpoints"".

All methods I tried are quite slow so far. One of the best performing was the Ramer-Douglas-Peucker algorithm (RDP). Other optimization routines, like the ones implemented on https://github.com/cjekel/piecewise_linear_fit_py using routines from `scipy.optimize` were even more costly.

Pre-conditioning the signal `x[n]` and reducing it's size is already an important step. So I downsample according to the amount of detail that seems important. But I couldn't think of any further optimizations so far.

Any ideas?

/edit:
PS: Even though I'm looking at this since quite some time on/off I just now found the Visvalingam-Whyatt algorithm, which seems to outperform RDP

Satellite Downlink to Software Defined Radio (SDR): Required Sampling Rate?,8,daq5x2,https://www.reddit.com/r/DSP/comments/daq5x2/satellite_downlink_to_software_defined_radio_sdr/,5,1569757293.0,"Hey everybody, I posted this on the RTL-SDR subreddit but thought I'd also have luck here. 

 I am a huge beginner on software defined radio (SDR) usage and signals processing and wanted to ask a couple of questions that I'm not 100% sure about:

How exactly does the SDR process signals from satellites that transmit at high frequencies (frequencies that are past 2x the SDR's sample rate)?

For example, let's say I wanted to get downlink data from a cube satellite that transmits at 400 MHz. I thought that I would need to sample this signal at a sampling rate of at least 800 MHz, the Nyquist rate, in order to receive non-aliased data. However, this is not the case since the SDR's maximum sample rate is 3.2 Megasamples/sec which is much much lower than 400 MHz. From some basic research and this [past thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/RTLSDR/comments/5j57ug/what_is_the_sample_rate_sampling/) \- is the reason why the SDR doesn't need a sample rate of 800 Megasamples/sec because the ""carrier"" signal is ""modulated"" to something that can be ""easily read""?? I use quotes because I am unsure if I used these terms properly...

2.

I am interested in receiving the same satellite signal from two different antenna+SDR systems that are at different locations/distances away from the satellite. I am estimating that the difference in time that the two systems will receive the signal will be in the \~50 nanosecond range. If the RTL-SDR can record amplitude vs. time data in .wav format, will it be possible to detect this nanosecond difference in the two signals (assuming the clocks are synced) with the RTL-SDR? Or, at this point, is it completely dependent on the SDR's sampling rate? In this case my minimum delta t is 1/3.2 MHz = 312 nanoseconds. Would this mean the time difference would be undetectable?

I hope my questions were worded properly. Any links to relevant information would also help me out to understand this subject better!",2019-09-29 06:41:33

Can someone help me understand how this tube emulation creates only even harmonics?,6,d0jv59,https://www.reddit.com/r/DSP/comments/d0jv59/can_someone_help_me_understand_how_this_tube/,8,1567820285.0,"There's a tube emulation plugin in Ableton called dynamic tube that confuses me a lot. Hardly any saturation plugins have an option to rectify a waveform (to make only even harmonics) but I've found a way to do it without explicitly using a rectifier wave shaper and instead using envelopes.

This plugin I'm using has an option to use an envelope to modulate the bias (aka how non-linear the wave shape is) based on the input signal. I don't explicitly know the envelope shape but from the website I found:

> Negative Envelope values create expansion effects by reducing distortion on loud signals, while positive values will make loud sounds dirtier. Attack and Release are envelope characteristics that define how quickly the envelope reacts to volume changes in the input signal.

Here's where it gets weird and what I don't understand. When the envelope is positive I get even+odd harmonics, but when it's negative I get *only* even harmonics.

But it get's weirder. When I make the input signal smaller, the harmonics get **louder**. The harmonics also get louder the smaller the attack and release times of the envelope are.

**Why does a negative envelope (or expanding the dynamic range) cause even harmonics?**

Stupid question: I need to evaluate 8-bit FFT. Can I just take the 8 MSB and run a 16bit of 32bit FFT ?,9,d026xz,https://www.reddit.com/r/DSP/comments/d026xz/stupid_question_i_need_to_evaluate_8bit_fft_can_i/,11,1567725610.0,"edit: title should say ""16bit **or** 32bit FFT"".

We have some hardware that can only do 8bit FFTs. My colleague needs to know if our software will work at that accuracy. I tested 16bit FFTs where the first 8bits were all 0, so only 8bits were really used. My colleague is unsatisfied.

I'm struggling to find any libraries online anywhere where I can run an 8bit FFT. Numpy will take 8bit data and convert it to 32bit before doing an FFT.

Do you know where I can find a library to do this?

Is my previous method already sufficient?",2019-09-05 18:20:10
Question about Hilbert Transform,8,cjepez,https://www.reddit.com/r/DSP/comments/cjepez/question_about_hilbert_transform/,12,1564451388.0," Hi All,

I have a couple of questions about the Hilbert Transform.

I am not the most proficient at DSP but have programmed a couple of filters before, so bear with me. 

I am trying to do the Hilbert Transform in Excel (and subsequently in C later) with a set of data. The data I have has a timestamp and a data point.

If the hilbert transform of a function is 1/pi\*integral\[ f(x)/(t-x)  \]dx

1. what is t?
2. what is x?  f(x) is my function I think.
3. For my time domain excel integration dx would be the data point minus the previous? 

For the integration I can just add the previous point with an initial condition of 0

This is where I got my definition.

Time-Frequency Ridges,7,c4vzo9,https://www.reddit.com/r/DSP/comments/c4vzo9/timefrequency_ridges/,8,1561440022.0,"Hey r/DSP,

Question on FIR coefficient selection: Unequal numbers of precursors and postcursors,8,c4td9k,https://www.reddit.com/r/DSP/comments/c4td9k/question_on_fir_coefficient_selection_unequal/,23,1561431009.0,"I've a question on the fitting of FIR filter coefficients, specifically methods of doing so when the filter has an unequal number of precursor and postcursor taps. I've posted on the DSP Stack Exchange, but no luck so far so I thought I'd chance my arm here. Any help is very much appreciated. :)


I'm trying to fit an FIR filter to the measured frequency response (magnitude, and eventually phase) of a device. The frequency response is essentially a low-pass filter. I'd like to vary the number of taps to see how many are necessary to appropriately match the response, but also give differing number of precursor and postcursor taps in the design.


I've investigated Matlab's fdesign.arbmag and fdesign.arbmagnphase functions, but these seem to only give designs with the same number of pre- and post-cursor taps.


Here's some sample Matlab code with simplified frequency (F) and amplitude (A) values for reference.


    F = 0:0.1:1;
    A = [1 0.85 0.9 0.7 0.5 0.3 0.35 0.1 0.2 0.1 0];
    filterOrder = 7;


    d = fdesign.arbmag('N,F,A',filterOrder,F,A);
    Hd = design(d);
    fvtool(Hd)
    tapWeights = [Hd.numerator];
    disp(tapWeights)


The above code runs happily, and produces a low-pass filter that matches the frequency response reasonably well, with tap weights as follows: [0.0030 0.0361 0.2161 0.4500 0.2161 0.0361 0.0030].

However, the central tap (the cursor, 0.45) is surrounded by three precursor and three postcursor taps. Is there a way to design, say, with one precursor and six postcursors?


Suggestions for Matlab methods would be brilliant, but even suggestions towards algorithms, etc., would be great too.",2019-06-24 21:50:09
Recovering a Distorted Image With No Prior Information,7,bstq1y,https://www.reddit.com/r/DSP/comments/bstq1y/recovering_a_distorted_image_with_no_prior/,1,1558814463.0,"In this note, I'm going to present an algorithm that can, without any prior information, take a scrambled image, and reassemble it to its original state. In short, it shows that even if we know nothing about a distorted image, we can still figure out what the image was supposed to look like using information theory. 

The only input to the algorithm is data derived from the scrambled image itself, and the algorithm isn't recognizing objects. It is instead, rearranging the scrambled image in a manner intended to maximize the expectation that any objects in the image will be reassembled.

Instantaneous frequency and frequency modulation,9,bst69k,https://www.reddit.com/r/DSP/comments/bst69k/instantaneous_frequency_and_frequency_modulation/,4,1558809939.0,"Hi all,

For a long time I'd had problem implementing discrete frequency modulations for predefined time-variated frequency functions. (*if you've already tried to implement a decrease linear modulation on a naive way, for example, you probably know what I'm talking about*)

After read a little (*I'm not an expert in DSP*), I'd figured out that my frequency modulation issues could be solved by something called  *Instantaneous Frequency* so I'd decided to have an analytical trip into this subject.

Biquad coefficients to pole-zero locations?,9,bklzcd,https://www.reddit.com/r/DSP/comments/bklzcd/biquad_coefficients_to_polezero_locations/,16,1557010786.0,"Hello guys,


so as my username suggests I am a total DSP-noob. Now I get how to calculate biquad coefficients based on EQ parameters, you can look up the formulas for that - it's pretty straight forward.


Now my issue is the following: I want to build an audio-rate parametric EQ in pure data. For that I have to cascade two pole filters (cpole~) into two zero filters (czero~). 


I kept looking but I just can't figure out formulas for the filter coefficients of those. Does anybody know how to convert biquad coefficients into those filter positions? I know I need  to end up with a real value and an imaginary value for each filter, meaning I need 8 values.


Or better yet: Is it possible to calculate those values based on filter-type, center frequency, Q, and gain?",2019-05-04 17:59:46
The inverse Nyquist: why is there seemingly no theorem for the limits of low frequency measurement?,8,bc5coo,https://www.reddit.com/r/DSP/comments/bc5coo/the_inverse_nyquist_why_is_there_seemingly_no/,11,1555046522.0,"Your ability to measure low frequency processes is limited by the number of samples you have collected in a way that seems to be ""reciprocal"" to the Nyquist theorem for high frequency processes.

If you have a 1000 Hz sampling rate and collect 1000 samples (1s of samples), and consider only those samples, clearly the lowest frequency you could possibly consider is 1 Hz, the case of the signal repeating every second. In practice, to establish a periodic event within this window (without considering any other samples), you'd need to observe the low frequency event twice, so the actual lower limit of frequency resolution is 2 Hz (i.e. an event that is 500 samples long). It takes 2 s to measure 1 Hz heartbeat.

Within 1000 samples under these conditions, and no assumptions about what happened prior to these 1000 samples, you can only have information for events in the frequency range 2 < f < 500 Hz. The Fourier transform will lump any very low frequency processes in the lowest frequency bin (fs/N) making indistinguishable from DC for that number of samples.

If you track results over a long time period (tracking many frames of 1000 samples), you can measure long term processes. That could include using a filter which effectively tracks past results in its delay elements.

This all seems intuitively correct: how could you tell the difference between DC and a very low frequency event if you only look at a small time window? Or practically, you don't notice the tide coming in when you first step on the beach, but you'll notice after a few minutes.

But I have questions:

1. Is there a proper theorem and name for this low frequency phenomenon?
2. Are there any results that deviate from this being pretty much a reciprocal of Nyquist?
3. Why doesn't this seem to be discussed in standard textbooks?",2019-04-12 00:22:02
Recent math graduate looking for career advice,7,baorzu,https://www.reddit.com/r/DSP/comments/baorzu/recent_math_graduate_looking_for_career_advice/,16,1554722389.0,"I think signals processing is the direction I want to go professionally.  

I just graduated with a BA in Math from UF.  My gpa is 2.96 : /  I have no relevant professional or intern experience.   I am very comfortable with applied Fourier analysis, linear algebra, numerical methods and MATLAB.

Recently, I applied to Leidos and made it through 2 interviews before I got a ""thanks but no thanks"".  I think I know why and have fixed that issue.

I am struggling to find jobs offering entry level positions.  I am also having a hard time finding something as juicy as the Leidos job.  (for me, juicy means that I am focused on algorithm development, not designing PCBs or using a language other than MATLAB/Python).  

I would like to find some cool projects and build a portfolio on github, but I need to find some cool projects 1st.  I feel like something basic I did in school like matched filter to detect a signal in noise is too basic.  Am I wrong? Does anyone have suggestions for cool projects?

Question about Transient Detection by Attack Envelope,8,b9q1ae,https://www.reddit.com/r/DSP/comments/b9q1ae/question_about_transient_detection_by_attack/,3,1554492666.0,"**Hello Everybody!**

**I am working on a transient detection algorithm and I have come across some  formulas and it made me a little bit confused. I hope you can help me with understanding some stuff. I have written some questions down below.**

**But here some background info first***:*

*Attack Envelope is calculated using a peak follower algorithm. A transient detection is registered when the present output*

*of the peak follower is a certain ratio greater than the preceding output.*

https://preview.redd.it/i72m3vd7jfq21.jpg?width=607&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e3588e51277ce767bf55f8d0bc4ded211e8e1e06

*In order to calculate an attack envelope like on figure above, we use ""block-based scan"" technique. For practical reasons of computational speed, the peak follower is set to consider samples in blocks of 50 (≈1.1ms @ 44.1kHz sample rate). Prior to the scan, the waveform is divided into these (consecutive, non overlapping) blocks and the maximum absolute value is passed to the detection algorithm:*

&#x200B;

**y(n) = max {x(nt + m)} , m starts from 0 and ends at M-1. (1st formula)**

&#x200B;

**where:**

**x(t) is the sample sequence (starting with t=0),**

**y(n) is the sample-block sequence that is passed to the detection algorithm,**

**m indexes samples within each block,**

**M is the block size (50, in this case)**

&#x200B;

**Detection**

&#x200B;

*At each sample-block, the peak follower is updated to the new sample-block value if that is higher, or a fixed proportion (close to 1) of its old value, so as to simulate exponential decay*:

&#x200B;

**P (n) = max{y(n), P(n-1)xKdecay}   (2nd formula)**

&#x200B;

**where P(n) is the peak follower output for sample-block n,**

**Kdecay is the decay factor,**

&#x200B;

**A detection is registered when:  P (n) / P(n-1) > TDAE**

&#x200B;

*where TDAE is the Detection Threshold (for the Attack Envelope method), above which a hit is registered, (all other symbols defined as above).*

&#x200B;

**So my questions are:**

**- In 1st formula what does t and n signify? How does the circle work?**

**- How de we calculate Kdecay and how do we assign it?**

**-How do we calculate TDAE and how do we assign it?**

&#x200B;

**I would be more than happy if you can take a little time and share your very precious knowledge with me!**

&#x200B;

**All the best,**

How is autocorrelation done in practice?,9,aysqyg,https://www.reddit.com/r/DSP/comments/aysqyg/how_is_autocorrelation_done_in_practice/,22,1552094356.0,"I am interested in trying autocorrelation in Javascript. I have sought videos and it seems that different people understand autocorrelation in different ways, so here some examples of what I mean:

* [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/autocorrelation.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/autocorrelation.asp)
* [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autocorrelation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autocorrelation)

I am interested not in measuring correlation level, but actually finding a most possible periodicity, in other words, when does something repeat itself. One usage case is finding looping points of a sound sample, or BPM on a sound piece, using some sort of change envelope. 

In my mind, to do this, it would take measuring RMS of the sums between the sound sample with itself, using different displacements and accepting the highest value as the most likely interval... This would take an impractical amount of processing time, since sound uses quite a fast sampling rate.

So, how do 'people' usually find these most-correlated intervals within a sample? does it necessarily take brute-force to find it out? 

I have sought a lot, but I feel I am missing key concepts or something, because I haven't found anything useful. I also have trouble because I don't 'speak math' that much, so Wikipedia is not much of help either.",2019-03-08 19:19:16
