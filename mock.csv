Russian Adobe Support Service,23,4x8nz7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Adobe/comments/4x8nz7/russian_adobe_support_service/,2,1470959399.0,"A user on Russian entertaining website called pikabu.ru has recently posted a complain about Russian tech support of Adobe. Here's a translation.

So, the user decided to install a licensed version of Photoshop+Lightroom (I think it's called a photoghaper's bundle), because that was the cheepest one. In Russia it only costs about 4.7 USD, but when that user confirmed everything, he had to pay 10 USD, and his region was automatically changed to USA instead of Russia (WUT). The user was not asked about his region before, and assumed his region was automatically set as Russian (he accesed the Russian website, sooooo...). The ""change your region"" button said ""contact the tech support to change your region"", and that's where the fun part starts.

First a wall, the tech support only works as a web chat. No phone calls, no emails, nothing. It only works from 10am to 6pm. The user started a chat at around 12am, but there are only 2 operators (WUT x2), named ""Tatiana"" and ""Marina"". After 40 minutes of waiting, ""Tatiana"" finally answered:

Tatiana: Thank you for your patience!

Tatiana: Right now there are some techinical problems on ADOBE website, and we cannot check your profile. Please start a new chat later. Sorry for temporary inconvenience!

Tatiana:

Tatiana: Thank you for contacting us!

The user tried to conact the support the next day. That's what he got:

Chat started

Alexandr Zykov: Hello, my adobe id region was automatically set as USA, even though I was not asked about it, can I change it?

Operator (there is no screenshot, so I don't know the name): Thank you for your patience!, blah blah blah

Operator: Thank you for contacting the tech support!

Operator: You are now talking to xxxxxxxx

Operator: No, you cannot

Chat ended

The user tried to start a chat the 3rd (!) time, asking about if he can delete this adobe id and create a new one with the same email address, and had to wait another 40 minutes

Alexandr Zykov: Hello, can I change the region? I have no idea how my region is USA

Maria: no, you cannot change the region

Alexandr Zykov: Then why does the button say ""contact the support to change our region""

Alexandr Zykov: ?

Maria:...so that the tech support checks your region and told you that you cannot change it

Alexandr Zykov: Okay, if I delete this account and create a new one with the same email address, find where to set a region, and put ""Russia"", would I be charged rubles instead of USD?

Maria: you cannot create a new one with the same email

Maria: new profile

Alexandr Zykov: If I delete that one, why can't I register a new one with the same email?

Maria: because

Maria: Alexandr, what are these questions?

Maria: we have rules, and you have been told them

Maria: if there were other ways to do that, wouldn't we tell you?

Alexandr Zykov: Well, if I delete the profile through the tech support, wouldn't it be logical that it gets deleted from your lists with the email address? So I can use that email for a new account? Isn't that how it works?

Maria: that's not how it works

Maria: what stops you from creating a new profile with your country set as a region?

Alexandr Zykov: I agree to stay with this ID, if you help me with this situation. The ID was registered in Russia, and there were no questions about my region, or else I would choose Russia. But the system decided that for me, and now I am being charged 2 times more for the same thing

Maria: you cannot change you region, you cannot stay with this profile, if you still want to buy it in rubles

Maria: if you don't have another email, just create the same one with a 0 at the end

Maria: and then register an account in Russia, check that you region is Russia

Maria: and buy a subscribtion

Alexandr Zykov: that's not my fault, and I can't do anything about it...

Alexandr Zykov: I want to stay with this email, not a new one, this address get all the bussiness emails

Maria: sorry, can't help you

Maria: if you were on the Russian website, it's impossible that your region was set to USA

Alexandr Zykov:I used an Ipad app

Alexandr Zykov:There was no choice for a region

Maria:there was

Maria: we said everything we could say for your problem

Alexandr: I couldn't not choose a region, if I was questioned about it, trust me

Maria: Can't say anything new

Alexandr: Okay, can I get an email address of your main office guys?

Maria: no

Maria: i can transfer you to american tech support, maybe they can do something about it

Maria: should i?

Alexandr: yes, please

The American tech support:

Alexandr: can you change my Adobe ID region to Russia, please

Bharath S: I understand you want to change the country.

Alexandr: yes

Bharath S: I will be glad to check and assist you.

Bharath S: I checked and see that the account is registered with United States.

Bharath S: May I know which country you want to change?

Alexandr: I would like to change it to Russia

Bharath S: Please stay online while I change the country for you.
Alexandr: ok

Bharath S: Thank you for your patience.

Bharath S: I have successfully changed the country and also sent you a password reset and verification email to you.

Bharath S: Is there anything else I can help you with?

Alexandr: THANKS A LOT!!!!!

Long time Lightroom user here with a word of warning....

I ran out of CC cloud storage and contacted Adobe to explore my options....The “technician” misinterpreted my request for more storage in the adobe cloud and thought I wanted more space on my laptop. 

I thought he was asking me to delete the temporary Adobe files on my laptop but he instead directed me to delete all of the files in the (hidden) /etc folder on my MacBook Pro. This turned out to be a disastrous mistake and rendered my MacBook instantly useless. Passwords wouldn’t work, fingerprints wouldn’t be recognised, apps wouldn’t connect to the internet and eventually my laptop shut itself down and I wasn’t able to log back in. 

A two-second google search revealed that the files in the /etc folder are crucial for the laptop to work and even Apple support were unable to help.

At one point in the transcript, I mentioned the problems I was having to the technician and he replied “don’t worry about those files”. 

I have contacted Adobe and I am waiting to hear back from them.

They’ve gone from one time pay CS6 bulk seat licenses to a god awful CC subscription model draining thousands from our budget yearly. 

Last year it was installed on particular computers. This year we have to register specific students as users on the specific computers we have CC on. And man, is this glitchy and annoying. 

Firstly I object because students who took the course in previous years are not able to sit down at a CC computer and use the software they’ve been trained on unless we register them with Adobe. I said “register all our high school students” but IT says Adobe won’t let them. 

Seriously? WTF? Why would they put this frustrating step in the process as well as prevent trained students from using their software and develop an affinity for it before they leave high school?? Very short sighted. Get them young and train them hard. Looks to me that Adobe is too big now to care.",2019-09-06 18:57:23

I go to cancel it, there is no cancel button in my account settings. I chat to support:

**Myself:** Did I sign up for an Adobe XD subscription? Yes or no?

**Adobe:** You did not sign up but it is provided in replacement of Typekit so that you will have access to Adobe Fonts after Typekit is expired.

**Myself:** So then you signed me up for it. To my knowledge, it was a free 12 months, nothing more. So then why should I be obligated to cancel anything? I didn't sign up for it, nor did I know it'd be automatically renewed.

I have a powerful suggestion for Adobe that would create much good will for them. As a retiring designer, I am going to be living off a limited income and social security. I think Adobe should offer their loyal customers (I have been using Adobe since Illustrator came on a 3.5″ floppy disk) with the same discount that they give students. Heck, even my public golf course offers that feature. Those of us retired designers and senior citizens are not going to be as active using CC, but it least it allows us to get at our old files, phots, videos, etc. Otherwise, if you can’t afford the extra standard license expense, you have no access to your whole career worth of material.

Who wants to get on board with me! We can make this a movement and, in the end, it will be great publicity for Adobe (and probably a bit of income that they are now missing).",2019-12-02 19:15:10

Kameswararao: Chen I cannot promise you in this regard but within 24-48 business hours you will receive a mail from our team.
 

On 29-June, I want to check the status of my issue.

Apurv: I really apologize as the case is pending with our next level of support, as soon as they pick your case they will contact you.

Apurv: Okay, in this case i request you to please wait for the time span provided, you will definitely receive the email.
 

So I waited 48 hours for the solution. Then on 1-July, I checked again because I received nothing. No email.

Mukul: I am escalating the case to my senior team as they need time to work on this. Please allow us 24 working hours to resolve this.
 
Chen: Last time you said I would receive the email in 24 hours but nothing.

Mukul: Chen I apologize for last time, this time you will receive email.

Chen: I believe that you should stand on your own words. Is this right?

Mukul: Yes, I will Chen.
 

You see that I have to wait for another 24 hours. OK, I wait. On 3-July, I checked again and this was my fault as business hours did not include weekends.

Ankit: I am sorry Senior team is only available in business days yesterday there was a week off so don't worry they will get back to you as soon as possible.

Chen: Next 24 hours? You are sure?

Ankit: Yes!
 

Then on 4-July, it is almost a week, I connected to the supervisor, not an agent. During these time, I receive nothing about the process.  But this time, it seemed this problem would be solved quickly.

Neha: So let me connect your chat to my supervisor so that you would be assist further

Priyanka Nautiyal: As I have checked with my senior team who are working with this case that it will be done with in next 24-48 hours .

Chen: Your first three agents cheated. And you are a senior. Can you stand on your own word?

Priyanka Nautiyal: Yes I will. This just happened due to a techincal glitch and the Technical team is already looking into this for you.

Priyanka Nautiyal: I will send you a confirmation to your email by my end.

Priyanka Nautiyal: I completely understand your frustration and I am also appreciate your time that you have waited for so long . Kindly request please give us 48 hours to work on your case . I assure you that with in 48 hours this will be resolved . 
 

Today is 7-July. There is no confirmation from Priyanka and no email from Adobe Support Team. This is the last time I connect to the dishonest team.

Pooja: This is Pooja, one of the supervisor of Adobe.

Chen: So can you tell how much time it will be

Pooja: I will not commit any time, as I don't want to lie.
 
Chen: OK, can I post our chat log online like reddit or your formal forum

Chen: I want more people know what difficulty they will meet when they look for your help.

Pooja: Yes, you can but I request you to please allow us some time.
 
In the end, no one will know when this problem will be solved. The agents are liars and do nothing for your problem. They cheat me again and again, and they do not care about my problem. I know I am just one person but I believe that everyone should stand on their own word.",2017-07-07 09:18:37

I can be working on one 300DPI print file with Microsoft Edge open and I get a warning from Photoshop about RAM or a random shutdown. After about 30mins it can't even handle the animated zoom and it crashes. I tried uninstalling Photoshop and reinstalling it and I get the same results. I'm pretty positive its the 64bit version too and it's installed on an SSD.  

It's crazy because I can run a video game like Prey, which I would assume is more taxing on the GPU and CPU, and nothing happens. Does this really come down to the OS, Windows 10/MacOS? Somebody please help. I work from home every other Monday and this makes work a drag. My work iMac literally has about 7 apps open, multiple Firefox tabs and windows, and it rarely ever crashes.

Discovered my Premiere auto-updated today in the middle of a project, despite auto-update being unchecked in Creative Cloud. I was only one version behind on 13.1 because of multiple (built-in) audio plugins not working and the fact that I have multiple long-format projects ongoing that rely on them.

I'm sure everybody here is aware of Adobe's push to force everyone to update to the latest version...ADOBE--I WOULD UPDATE IF THE DAMN THING WORKED!!! But your updates are breaking CORE BUILT-IN functionality

Now I'll probably have an issue with a new project being created in the newer version unable to open in the older, working one. STOP IT ADOBE. Every time I update another application, CC prompts me to enable auto-update. No application that calls itself professional should be auto-updating like this! Especially when updates are so fragile.

Their responses was to use CC to download Premiere CS6, which would install Encore alongside it. This, of course, removed all of the direct integration between the two apps and that was inconvenient but at least the program was still available. I have continued to use it ever since. Physical media isn't dead and Blu-Ray authoring is still a big part of what I do for work. 

Well Adobe just discontinued several older iterations of their apps, including the CS6 versions. Encore is officially dead. Worse, they're telling us we can be sued if we have it on old computers and use it anyways. 

Well fuck exactly off, Adobe. If they have to get rid of old versions of Premiere because their licenses are in dispute, they need to give back what they just took away. They need to release a Creative Cloud edition of Adobe Encore",2019-05-15 07:57:11

My issue is the creative cloud licensing BS. I use device licenses as I work for an educational institution and we do not provide create cloud IDs to students. As such, I use device licenses for my labs. Simple, right?  
No. If a user decides to log into their personal creative cloud account, it immediately associates that computer with their account, effectively breaking the device license. Now, the products won't even launch and just provide a less than helpful message about the license being expired. Huh. Weird since you allow people to create accounts for free but your products are over 100 bucks. Then a simple login will automatically make them feel ""on the hook"" for a hundred bucks.

Why allow machines with device licenses access to the creative cloud at all? How can some free accounts on the internet break my domain admin control over software? Adobe is aware enough of the issue to create a license package to remedy the problem, however, it doesn't appear to be effective either, at least not totally. It worked on 4 machines, not on the other 20. I can't really see a difference between them. Literally a lab. Literally the same model of computer in the same state, with the same software load. I'm obviously frustrated.

Thanks, Adobe. I don't need my software developer to jump on the cloud bandwagon. I can decide where to store my files just fine. I get it too. They spent so many years having their software pirated, but there has to be a better, easier-to-support way.

I'm an illustrator, looking at an iPad Pro as a sort of digital sketchbook/quick pieces tool. I love the idea of having a portable drawing tablet.

I'm just wondering a few things - The software I see most people talking about is Adobe Photoshop Sketch, which I believe is a free app - and you can make a free Adobe CC account with. Is this the case? I don't have a paid Adobe CC subscription as I use an older version of Photoshop on my (windows) laptop.

With those factors - will I run into any issues when drawing on the iPad? I'm hoping I can fairly easily transfer the files over to my laptop for further working/storage/uploading places.

I'm also wondering whether I can add brushes i've already bought (Kyles brushes - .tpl files) to the 'Sketch' app?

I've had a google about this but I haven't found anything TOO reassuring.

If anyone is able to help or offer suggestions that'd be really helpful!!",2017-10-19 11:53:04

I tried down scaling to other resolutions (I've tried 1440p 60FPS, 1440p 30FPS, 1080p 60FPS, and 1080p 30FPS) and now I'm at 1080p 30FPS with a .m4v file and the video still does the same thing, it gets choppy after watching like 10 seconds then just eventually stops working, along with that scrubbing is impossible to do at all.

The Adobe Breach: Fucking Up My Inbox.,5,egjff7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Adobe/comments/egjff7/the_adobe_breach_fucking_up_my_inbox/,9,1577521606.0,"# Context. Because you need it.

Adobe. Their servers. My ProtonMail. A couple of Indonesians. And 7.5 million others.

Let's start with 3 of those.

Flash back to October 26. Adobe had just release information on a [7.5 million person data breach](https://thehackernews.com/2019/10/adobe-database-leaked.html). What was stolen?  
  

* Email addresses
* Account creation dates
* The Adobe products they subscribed to
* Subscription statuses
* Payment statuses
* Member IDs
* Countries
* Time since the last login.

Not much, right? Well, with an estimated 15 million person data breach, this was a Thanos snap across Adobeland. Sure, not much was stolen. But there is something more valuable than the others. If you guessed emails, you'd be correct!  


# The Actual Scamming: What you came for.

Now let's flash forward to yesterday. I had just woke up and was ready to start my day. I checked my phone, and, to my surprise, I got an email! I thought this was a business offer or such, but something strange was on the notification. The email looked a little similar to:  


> \[Account Update\] \[ Today Information \] - \[New explanation added\] \[Summary Service Added\] Automatic Email Statement Update 16552

I thought this was strange. After all, I only use my business email for job offers (LinkedIn, basically. Nothing else) and Adobe. It looked incredibly fishy and I tapped on it to see what was in store.

The email it was sent to was from [""accoun-info@amazon.com](mailto:""accoun-info@amazon.com)"". I knew this was definitely a fake, but how did they get my email? I only signed up for LinkedIn and Adobe, and even then, I knew for a fact LinkedIn was not at fault here.

Apparently, I hovered over the image, and the link was [google.com](https://google.com). The real Google. Why?

A couple of hours ago, we fast forward to. I get another email from ""Apple"". What? Turns out, similar fucking scammers. Same [google.com](https://google.com) image URL, but they ramped up the quality. Actual email looked more realistic, except for the fact they made a couple grammatical errors and tried to get me to download a PDF. Yeah, no shit, I'm not doing that.

In every email is a header, which gives you a good idea on who is on the other line, because you get to see their computer name and IP address. Turns out, both IP addresses are not too far apart, and are both located in Indonesia.

So why am I getting these emails? After all, I know ProtonMail couldn't have had the data breach. LinkedIn never had a data breach.

That leads me to my conclusion. Stupid fucking Adobe is filling up my inbox with scams. For the first time in history, I'm actually getting scam emails.

Go to fucking Hell, Adobe. I'll be watching over you as you burn with those Indonesians.

# Author Note.

I'm not denying that it's possible LinkedIn could have had a breach. It's often they have a breach. But the timing is exactly 2 months after (not exaggerating) since word got out about the breach. Seems a little suspicious.

These things happen. Sure. But this is just plain irresponsible. Adobe had no quality control in hashing/salting email addresses, not just passwords.

Both emails are reported as phishing and I've contacted Indonesian police about the scammers with damning evidence that they are not the real Amazon/Apple.

Two things trump all else when it comes to life: Security, and privacy. This is a breach of both. I'm not pleased at Adobe's performance here, as I stated before.

If anyone here has seen these emails, come forward. I want to know if this is just a me issue or if you guys have had this issue. Again, 50/50 chance here. I'll edit this if I find more information. But for now, zero people have come forward about this and it's time to stop that. This is major.",2019-12-28 02:26:46

The software is activated offline (with serialization) which is necessary in our VDI environment, where an employee gets a fresh virtual desktop every day. Advantage is we purchased the software once, it remains supported for five years, then we need to upgrade to a new version.

Now Acrobat DC 2017 is still available but will expire in two years, yet the cost is the same (but now for two instead of five years).

After this version, Adobe does not allow this activation method anymore. It has to be named user-based (with cloud login) or offline using an activation package, created with their licensing cloud portal. Quite complex stuff taken in mind that the lifespan of a VDI desktop is usually 8 hours.

Of course Acrobat is the king in PDF land, but are there any feasible alternatives to Acrobat (Standard or Pro) for the usual work (creating PDFs, combining PDFs, commenting and so on) that are easier to deploy and have a similar feature set?",2019-11-25 22:42:57

The toggle switches were gone and in lieu of them was text saying “Available with CC”. I opened a support ticket and was told my version of CC is a “desktop only” version “available through certain educational organizations”. 

But...I signed up for my CC account directly through Adobe’s website...and I picked the full plan. I didn’t even know these “desktop only” versions existed, let alone where to get one. 

They’re telling me I have limited access to things like the font library, Behance, etc. In fact they told me I don’t have access to Behance at all, which is a lie seeing as how I’ve always been able to log into it and use it with no issues. 

So basically Adobe is lying to me saying I have a limited version of CC that I bought through an educational institution of some kind, even though I’ve told them that’s not the case and that I bought it through their website. They’ve ignored any evidence of this that I’ve given them and aren’t really offering any answers or help. 

Anybody experienced anything like this?

And then there's photoshop and Ilustrator which are both MUCH slower than the 2017-2018 versions.

And don't even get me started on Premiere pro. Davinci Resolve and Finalcut X are SO MUCH MUCH faster than premiere pro. specifically, stabilizing, tracking and rendering. As these functions do use more cores and the GPU much more efficient in there other software packages.

&#x200B;

Not to mention the horrible stability. How many times I get errors and crashes in Premiere where other software just works.

It truly is complete bullshit that I can't use the apps on this brand new computer. When I tried to chat with tech support tonight the guy immediately told me there was a technical problem on their end and I need to contact them in 2-3 hours. 

What the everlasting fuck is happening? Anyone else experiencing apps crashing on startup? I've looked at a lot of posts and forums to try and fix this, and the answer is always a clean install. That's just not practical in any sense. 

Thank you.

Adobe apps on iPad a mess,6,a7yk56,https://www.reddit.com/r/Adobe/comments/a7yk56/adobe_apps_on_ipad_a_mess/,4,1545345756.0,"Bought the new 12.9 iPad Pro to edit images of my artwork while on the go. I brought it along to the airport today thinking I could get some
work done but ended up really frustrated. The Adobe suite of apps like Photoshop Fix, PS Express and Lightroom all seem to do slightly different versions of the same thing. I tried editing RAW images in Lightroom only to find that it cannot navigate the folders I created in the Photos app. I had to scroll endlessly to find the right photo because it couldn’t see the folders. There is no share sheet or link if I try to import the photo directly from the Photos app. There is one for Photoshop Express that I can then export out of, but none of the other apps. 

Photoshop also crashed or stalled several times. These are large, 4,000 x 3,000 RAW files but I thought it’d be able to handle them. 

Anyone else experiencing these issues or have some tips? ",2018-12-20 16:42:36

Every. Single. Time. that I do license cleanup, I have to sit through a thirty minute chat with 2-3 Indian call center reps to have the licenses removed. Oh, there's an ""X"" next to them in the portal so you might *think* you can remove them, but clicking it just brings up a message to contact support.

Adobe is either trying to passive aggressively dissuade users from cancelling licenses, or their back-end infrastructure is run on hamster wheels, or both. It's unprofessional and a waste of time.

I'm a bit upset about my Adobe Customer Service Experience, so wanted to confirm I'm not being completely irrational before I email Adobe Management or take to the social media interwebs. 

Long story short, I agreed to a 1 year Photoshop Creative Cloud Subscription Model on 1/4/2016. I used Photoshop about 4 times. My last usage was 4/13/2016. I've paid $9.99 each month for the remaining 9 months in which I have not used the product. 

Today, I contacted Adobe to Cancel the Product/Subscription. They mentioned I would have a $50 cancellation fee because i'm in ""contract"" for another year (which I don't recall being notified of the renewal on)? 
 
Keep in mind, i'm not asking for $90 of non-use money back. All i'm asking is to NOT have a cancellation fee when cancelling a product that I've not used or updated for 9 months. 

Having a contract or signing a service agreement is nothing foreign to us these days. However, having poor customer service isn't too common. This is almost on Time Warner Cable's level.

IMO, there is no other pdf program, photo editor, and video creator better than Acrobat DC, Photoshop, and After Effects. But the pain one has to go through to buy access to these programs is ridiculous.   


On my adobe account, I had a single plan for Photoshop, AE, and Acrobat DC since I was the only employee that needed these programs for the job at the time. Now, we have two other employees that need Acrobat DC. I went to my adobe account and stopped auto renew for Acrobat. Then after too much time wasted searching how to buy multiple licenses for Acrobat on Adobe's page, I realize there is a Business plan. So I purchase three licenses. My coworker assigns the licenses to us three employees who will be using the software, although he assigns my license to my new work email rather than my old email linked to my existing adobe account. I didn't realize this at the time.  


This morning when I open Acrobat, I receive a notice that my plan has expired. I click activate license on pop up notice, and I receive another pop-up saying there is no license found. So I log in to adobe account and review current plans. Cannot find our purchased business plan for three Acrobat licenses... At the top of the webpage I see ""View Admin Console."" Not knowing what is going on, I wander to the admin console and see add users. So I add three users, since I thought we did something wrong the first time and did not purchase the plan initially. Never received a confirming order page or an invoice page. On admin console, it now shows 3/6 licenses used. Not good.  


Chat with adobe after I was unable to find anywhere on their website to remove licenses, and they tell me there is a cancellation charge of $110 to remove three licenses. I fought it, and thankfully they understood and cancelled the unused licenses I purchased by mistake and waived the ""cancellation fee."" But to even have a cancellation fee is so wrong in my opinion. We are already purchasing the app on a monthly basis. Why also include this fee???  


I was also still having trouble with being able to use Acrobat since I was still getting a plan expired notice. Adobe says to logout of acrobat and log back in and should work. Again, I spend WAY too much of my time just trying to figure out how to logout of Acrobat. Talk to Adobe, and now know that you have to close the app, open Adobe Cloud, and logout from there. To logout of a program from another program is INSANE.   


Not until three more tries to get into Acrobat did I realize my coworker had assigned my license to the new work email, so even more time wasted.   


To use an app, one should not have these problems. It's ridiculous how Adobe has this set up, and the fact that they have business plans separated from your adobe account, and can only be viewed on admin console is so asinine. The way Adobe's current website is set up, they should have a guide to read before even thinking about purchasing a plan. If it wasn't for Adobe's unrivaled programs my business would be elsewhere.

A Tale as Old as Tech: The Classic Laptop Buying Question,4,bi3h36,https://www.reddit.com/r/Adobe/comments/bi3h36/a_tale_as_old_as_tech_the_classic_laptop_buying/,3,1556427165.0,"People of Reddit, I ask of thee for guidance.

I’m in the market for a laptop… but not merely any laptop, no. I require a lightweight machine capable of running most adobe content creation programs, primarily Photoshop and Premiere infrequently. I know of [Adobe’s requirements](https://helpx.adobe.com/premiere-pro/system-requirements.html) for most machines, so I’ve been on the hunt for a long while now in search of what I seek. I already have a powerhouse PC at home that I use for design, rendering, gaming, etc. but I need something so I can work on the go. I often use my chrome remote desktop to work on my desktop remotely, but I burn through my data since my campus has RDP ports blocked. Additionally, the latency is a pain in the ass on occasion.

What I personally want is a refurbished MacBook from a couple of years back, as that seems to be the consistent recommendation among graphic designers. My deceased brother’s Macbook worked well for years after his passing, as my sister-in-law used it frequently until it met its defeat by the hands of a toddler. The main reason for my bias is that I consistently interact with people who own MacBooks and they always recommend them as a great school and work device. I also really like the connectivity possibilities for my iPhone. In my future profession, MacBooks are the proprietary machines, so I’m wanting to bite the bullet now.

However, my boyfriend works in IT and is vehemently opposed to me getting a MacBook. His main concerns are upgradability and repairability. With the newest MacBooks having soldered memory and encryption locked SSDs, they really can’t be modified from their off the shelf configuration. He thinks I should get a windows ultrabook-style laptop, and let my future work issue me a MacBook if they really want to.

My budget is $800-$1000. My boyfriend found [this](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07B7VFTN9/ref=psdc_13896615011_t2_B07D72WFHL#customerReviews). He likes it because both the memory and the storage are upgradeable if in the future I need more, plus it's on the low side of my budget. All of the MacBooks I have found in my price range seem to be five plus years old.

So my fellow Redditors, that’s the setup. My main questions are these: does anyone know of deals on slightly newer MacBooks, is it worth it to just save up to get a newer one to have for several years, does anyone have experience with a regular MacBook vs. a Pro for what I need, or does the machine my boyfriend found look like it will suit my needs?

TLDR: Can’t decide on a MacBook or PC for infrequent Adobe content creation and homework. Got any advice?

So i did and after a day or two i noticed that adobe has charged me some money, I immediately went to their page and login my account and try to cancel it through there or remove my credit card detail and you would be surprised hearing this ""THERE IS NO WAY THAT YOU CAN DO IT"" you basically can't do anything, can't cancel it and can't change the card detail as well. I tried finding info and couldn't find anything. 

So, after the huge disappointment i talk with the customer services or the spokeperson (By the way their spokeperson is shit as well that guy wanted an access to my computer even when there was no problem with my computer) they told me don't worry about it it gonna get canceled after 15 days and the money will be refunded.  

So 4 month back, i noticed that i have been charged monthly subscription fee of $24 NZD every month. I don't have access to anything even though they have been charging me all this time. I went to their webpage again login and try to cancel my subscription but nothing, there is nothing in there. So my only choice was to go the bank and change my card.

[QUESTION] Adobe CC skipping updates for schools?,3,akzxwt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Adobe/comments/akzxwt/question_adobe_cc_skipping_updates_for_schools/,5,1548796887.0,"TLDR: my school is stuck with Photoshop 2017 and the school manager says it's because Adobe doesn't release the newer versions for schools straight away. She lying? 

Hi ^^
I am enrolled in a well known animation school I'm not naming. At my school we use Adobe CC among other things.
The problem is, the actual programs installed in our pcs are the 2017 versions (eg Photoshop), and in some instances both the 2017 and 2018 ones (eg Illustrator, Premiere). The CC launcher doesn't even see any of these programs, saying ""try now"" instead of ""update"" in its app list.
I know 2017 is not that old of a version, but this school is extremely expensive and I feel a bit cheated. 

After a bit of back and forth with the school manager, where she would say she'll ""speak with the technician"", she eventually told me this: allegedly, the CC for schools doesn't update every program like the normal CC does. Instead, updates are put out only when they are deemed ""safe"" by Adobe. According to her, Photoshop 2017 is the latest ""safe"" version of Photoshop, and that's why we have that. ""Once Adobe says 2019 is safe we'll have it"".

Now, I'm not one to be quick to cry foul play. But I've been working in graphic design for a few years and I've absolutely never heard of something like this. I kinda smell bullshit here. I'm not saying the school uses cracks, BUT a story about another animation school using cracks recently came out, so it begs the question. The school manager is really not tech savy and is well known to not really listen to people, so it might even be that the tech guy had a sound explanation she is just unable to recall or repeat. I am thinking of asking Adobe directly, but I'm trying Reddit first. 

So, has anyone heard anything about Adobe putting CC updates out slowly for schools? ",2019-01-29 15:21:27

Currently Lightroom CC and Classic have pushed me to the limit today thus a rant!  Why, why Adobe do you have 2 apps??  You had Classic which was great at editing photos but didn’t really have cloud storage or seamless iOS integration.  Why not just make that work with “classic”? Nope, let’s create another app that has cloud integration but subpar editing and organization.  I don’t get it. It seems that you guys just limp along with all your software.  After effects is a joke.  You can barely playback a single 4K file with no effects on fast computers and don get me started on rendering speed.  Photoshop is still stuck in the year 2000 with how it operates.  I could go on and on.  The worst part is they have become industry standards and thus no need to improve, well I mean they come out with features every year that are pathetic.

Sorry for the rant, I guess what I’m looking for is 2 things...

First I can’t find any email to send Adobe any requests or issues.  In their support section, it just keeps trying to take me to a forum.  I don’t want a forum! I want to communicate with a company that I pay $600 a year for their service!!  Thoughts on how to get ahold of them?

Second, I implore this and all other communities that use Adobe products to force them to make their software better.  They have taken enough money from us, it’s time they get to work. ",2019-01-29 03:06:48

>

> Make your ""monthly"" plan ACTUALLY monthly instead of ANNUALLY. With no cancellation fees. When you say the plan is $10 a month, you'd think it would be a $10 a month plan, not a $120 a year plan. Just say it's a YEARLY plan instead of bandying words like a smarmy rat. People should be able to cancel the plan easily.

We do small time interactive novels and recently completed a project so I decided to suspend what I thought was a Month to Month account on a little used production unit as of December 2016.

Then, I decided we didn't need this many accounts and decided to end service to one of our Creative Cloud accounts. Adobe offered us 2 free months! 

Awesome right?

Except I was positioned returning to my Month to Month plan, which I was not.

So fast forward to today, we decided to turn off ""Month to Month"" on this unit to funnel the money to marketing where ever dollar counts at the level.

I was hit with a rather big bill for ending my yearly plan.

So, long story short, if you agree to Adobe’s two free months and are at Month to Month, check the fine print, they will switch you to a yearly plan. 

This plan has a hefty cancellation fee (its cheaper to downgrade to one of their other plans at 26 bucks a month and end your year with them...)

This is not me being a smarty pants. (if Adobe fixes this bug, I'll be fine with it)
This is me just working with a broken system.. and then realising that I shouldn't complain.. coz.. I'm sort of winning at the end of the day! 

So in December 2016 I decided to stop using my Credit card. I had struggled with Credit Card debt and decided it was time to get smart.

So after a year of paying for my Adobe CC licence with my credit card, I switched the payment method to Debit Card. 

The first payment went through.. and then the following month it failed! 
So suddenly I found myself switched over to a one month trial of Adobe CC . Until that expired. Then I payed for the next month with the same debit card.. and sure enough at the next month's payment date.. the payment failed again.. and I was back on the One month trial .. 

Again once the trial was over I had to manually pay for the next month with my debit card. 

Frustrating right?
I tried my best to get Adobe to see that there was some kind of glitch.. But they didn't . or rather their customer care system is not equipped to solve a problem like this.

So I told myself that the issue must be with my bank- HDFC Bank. 
They proved even less helpful... or er helpless is a better word.
And so I switched banks. I was now a proud account holder at Yes Bank.

Did this solve my issue.. nope. 
the same loop has started again.

This time Adobe actually got on the phone with me! And they still refused to accept that it was something they could fix on their side.. They wanted me to go tell my bank that they should allow Adobe to charge them.. 

So I was going to call my bank.. when.. 

EUREKA!

I just realized.. that instead of paying for Adobe CC every month.. I'm now only paying every alternate month. Why the heck am I complaining about that?

Adobe Apps Consistently Failing to Launch on OSX. Running out of ideas. Help.,4,3qvf2g,https://www.reddit.com/r/Adobe/comments/3qvf2g/adobe_apps_consistently_failing_to_launch_on_osx/,3,1446259140.0,"Hello!

I'm pretty sure this sub is *not* the appropriate place to post this, but I just can't figure out what else to do and I'm grasping at straws. Sometimes Reddit comes through, so who knows?

Basically, I can't run any Adobe apps on OSX anymore. I don't know why. I have experienced this on 4 different systems in the past month, running OSX 10.9, 10.10, and 10.11. The systems include an older Mac Pro 5,1, two brand new Mac Pro 6,1s, a 2011 MacBook Pro, and a 2015 Retina MacBook Pro.

The symptom is that no Adobe apps, with the exception of Acrobat and Media Encoder, will launch. They do not crash. They do not give an error. They do *nothing*. No bouncing icon, no splash screen, no process thread started in Activity Monitor.

I have uninstalled everything. I have run Adobe cleaner apps. I have scoured the systems and deleted every system file that ever referenced an Adobe product. I have repaired disk utilities, changed network adapters, changed routers, have experienced these problems on different ISPs from different physical locations. I have uninstalled and reinstalled everything imaginable in every order I can think of. 

And nothing. Launches. 

The one fix I have found is to completely wipe a hard drive and start with a fresh installation of the OS. This is, however, not a tenable solution because I use these apps to earn a living and the day-long process of completely wiping out a system just to get Photoshop to launch is unsustainable. 

So: help. I have no idea what else to do. I have tried every scrap of an idea proposed in the Adobe forums with no results. I have spent hours on the phone with Adobe's laughably underprepared tech support, only to have them literally give up and tell me they can't help with no followup suggestions. 

Does anyone have a sister who works at Adobe? An uncle who's a janitor there who could slip them a note that just says ""HELP"" + my phone number? 

Does anyone have good replacement ideas for:

Photoshop
Illustrator
After Effects

That I can learn *right now* and subsequently cancel my worthless CC subscription? 

At this point anything would help. ",2015-10-30 21:39:00

The process slows down my work considerably, because as part of my work, I have to open PDFs and close them again quickly (alt+F4 or keyboard macro), once I've seen what's inside them. The progress bar that pops up delays this process. Even when I'm able to close the PDF before the progress bar pops up, I still get the ""loading"" icon next to my cursor, and sometimes the next PDF is slower to open. I'd like to know, 1. Why is this happening? What's different about the way I'm scanning now, and is it possible I could change a setting in my scan desktop UI to prevent this from happening in the future? 2. Is there a way to turn this process off in Adobe Reader? Whatever it's doing I don't need it to do that for my work processes. 3. If there are no obvious solutions to the first two problems, can anyone recommend a lightweight, reliable PDF reader that will open and close documents with a short load time and without any splash screen or pay-lock (freeware basically).

Whats wrong with Animate?,3,drq43j,https://www.reddit.com/r/Adobe/comments/drq43j/whats_wrong_with_animate/,6,1572938279.0,"We are using Animate for a School project. I am pretty good with most of the other Adobe tools (Photoshop, Ilustrator, Indesign, Bridge, Lightroom, Premiere, Audition), but Animate just feels like its in an Alpha version. It feels like they developed it long ago. 

Meanwhile their other programs got Updates and QOL-Features, they just updated Animate, so it would function with their newer versions.



For Example:


- After drawing a simple Square with the rectangle Tool, you cant adjust the size with the normal selection Tool, Illustrator and Indesign can do this without a Problem.
You have to use the Transform Tool to get the Standard Outline.
But even with the Transform Tool, all the shortcuts for Transforming are completely messed up. When pulling on a corner it expands in all directions (the effect you normally get by pressing the Alt key), while pulling on a side, you cant extended to the sides, only in the direction you are pulling (it doesnt keep the side ratios even when the Shift Key is pressed)


- When you make a Mistake, you Press Ctrl + Z. In All the other programs you can redo your steps with Ctrl + Shift + Z, but not in Animate


- Multiple forms with the same color on the same Level combine or delete each other. Why didnt they just implement pathfinder that does exactly the same just in a more User-friendly way...


- Altough the magnetic feature is activated, objects dont latch onto guide lines


- The normal selection Tool can select fractions of drawn forms. It never does that in the other programs!



Sorry for the Rant, but Animate is a pain in the Ass to work with.

Am i the only one who feels that way or am i just over sensitive?

So you've been working all night and it's 2AM and you decide to go to sleep because you've got class tomorrow, you come home the next day, have lunch, go to the gym and come back ""oh boy I can't wait to continue my animation"" and you open up adobe animate cc 2019 and your file is not in your recent.

I SPENT HOURS AND HOURS ON THIS AND IT'S COMPLETELY GONE, IMAGINE PAYING £30 A MONTH FOR A PROGRAM THAT SENDS YOUR HARD WORK OFF OF THE ASTRAL PLANE, THIS IS COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE. WHY?

The wav file in the audition audio-disk-cache is of  appropriate size, but holds only silence. So now I'm wondering if osx  holds any temp file of the audio in another directory as it seems  windows does (as dicussed [here](https://jakeludington.com/2006/03/16/adobe_audition/)  with pretty much the same problem I have, but in windows). A second  thing I'm asking myself is if there is a ""deleted"" wav of my recording  that I could recover through e.g. easeUS data recovery or anything  alike. This is due to the fact that there has been a absolutely normal  waveform up until the crash. So the data must have been there at some  point, because I recorded in multi-track mode that directly writes to  the disk. Any help is greatly appreciated! Thanks",2019-06-20 00:27:36

Best tablet to work on Photoshop with?,3,aq8zol,https://www.reddit.com/r/Adobe/comments/aq8zol/best_tablet_to_work_on_photoshop_with/,2,1550107504.0,"Hello, I’m not sure if this is the right reddit to ask this on but I work frequently in Photoshop, specifically painting in Photoshop. Working on a Wacom tablet through my mac doesn’t feel natural, and the mouse definitely doesn’t feel natural as well. I was thinking about getting an actual tablet for this. Does anyone recommend a cheaper option for a nice tablet thats not like 1,000 dollars because thats a lot and as a student thats not really an option. I already have an iPad mini but the according to the Apple website the Apple pencil doesn’t work with the mini.

1. sync files from desktop to cloud ( within 1Gb see below for more details )~~within 5Gb/45 minutes limitations [higher resolution then 1080p or bitrate over 16Mbps is UNKNOWN if working]~~ Sometimes quitting CC then running as Administrator works to get them synced. Sometimes you need to sync a random photo or file to get it started. And appear in the CC asset window as Syncing.

2. Note: ( depending on project size) If video is on phone already and within limitations. It needs to be on Internal storage. Not on a SD card/External. This may vary, but I have had 0 luck with external storage, & trying to ""Send to Premiere"" afterwards.

3. Create or add videos from cloud to Adobe Clip.

4. Do your edits

5. let it sync then ""Send to Premiere""

Videos to adobe clip & Creative Cloud must be within 

Edit:(See below updates for more info on what works. This is just what adobe has told me)

 5 gigabytes to import / export / send to cloud. This is for any media you want to edit. From any import location. 

You cannot import video from device that is more than 5 gigabytes into adobe clip. I recommend 1Gb or less as i have not been able to Send to Premiere if file is larger.

You cannot import/export from creative cload or google drive a clip that is larger than 5Gb.

Adobe Cloud will not allow video files larger than 5 Gb to be stored.

Attempting to render to cloud or device will result in error or only a portion of video rendering if over 5Gb. 

Some Android Phones [Kit Kat, Marshmellow or my Galaxy S5] & maybe all. (Have not tested my Galaxy S7) May not be able to access SD card storage. You will be able to add and edit the clips. But when you attempt to ""Send to Premiere"" it will continuously Sync. Or will say Sync and nothing will be on the cloud. ( this turned out to be all Android devices )

Importing footage that is to long [possibly up to 1 hour or less. Over 1 hour did not work for me]. Will cause it not to sync to cload from adobe premier clip app. You can send it to the cloud from your computer. Open it in Premier Clip. But not the reverse, which is pointless to let me import it if you won't let me export. ( i now recomend under 1Gb but any length seems to work fine)

Exporting, sending or syncing multiple projects to premier will cause premiere clip to get stuck continuously syncing. It will say it synced but no files will be present.

Only attempt to send one project at a time to premiere from premiere clip. Otherwise you run the risk of this happening and loosing the projects, I lost 5. (7 now)

Up to 1080p footage has worked, I have not yet attempted 60fps or 2160p. I will report my findings when I cross that bridge. (1440p30 is working see below)

For larger clips i open them in premiere cc, split each one as best to size. Nest ea h clip individually. Select all nest clips. Then export>media. Set render settings. It opens in Media encoder. Then render each cut out & pray they are all under 1Gb. 

Hope this helps. ~ ATG.

Edit: additional info

Adobe Premier Clip uses .XML file type for the projects. I have not been able to recover the .XML file from exploring the phones files. And it appears no one knows where they are kept. If anyone knows how to do this please let me know.

Odd Issue: I have Clips that are 3 Gb, .mp4, 8Mb bitrate, & 45 minutes long. That will sync from creative cloud to Adobe Premier Clip. For some reason a video with the same export setting. But is 16 minutes long and 1.1Gb in size will not open/Sync to Premiere Clip. My solution is to create a blank title card or test pattern to fill in 29 minutes and up the file size.

Edit: Having Issues with Adobe Clip with 1440p footage exporting and importing on a Samsung Galaxy s10. I was able to get one file to sync that was under 1Gb. I was able to move the files manually onto the internal storage of the Galaxy S10. But after editing, Adobe Premier clip is having issues syncing the files still. The video clips where 15 minutes long. as attempting to cut 45 minute videos in adobe clip gets really difficult. 
Attempting 10 minute video clips now. may possibly all be under 1Gb file size.

Update: was able to sync to cloud from pc, open in Adobe Clip. A single 1440p 30fps 48 minute 3.8Gb video. Attempting to send to premier after cutting it down to 2 minutes, resulted in the app crashing. Attempted multiple times, it will say it is sending to premier but will then crash the app.


UPDATE & SUCCESS:

FINALLY, it seems video clips around 5 minutes 1440p30 and file size under 1Gb are syncing from my computer to the creative cloud. Then to my Galaxy S10, from the creative cloud into Adobe Clip. And able to make my edits and then, Send to Adobe Premier. Without issues syncing to the Creative Cloud.

ISSUE: i have 25 clips, when browsing creative cloud to import. Adobe clip does not understand Numbering. So i end up with 

Clip1, Clip10, Clip11, Clip19, Clip2, Clip20, Clip21. 

Resolved by doing ClipA1->ClipA9, ClipB1->ClipB9 and so on.

ISSUE: Adobe clip is suppose to import into timeline the clips in the order of how you select them. This is not happening, The file import screen is correct with putting them in order & i select them in order. But they still import out of order. But the same order as before. And will always import in the same order. I set in Creative Cloud & import screen to sort Alphabetically incase maybe it was going by date created,No difference made. Selecting the clips from top to bottom or bottom to top will be different orders. Attempted multiple patterns, but their is no pattern to the madness.

Importing video footage from internal storage will put it in order of selection.

FINAL UPDATE:

- Adobe premier clip will not export internal media projects larger than 5 Gb. If you have over 5Gb in clips in your project it will not sync. 

- video clips theirselves must be less than 5 minutes and under 1Gb

- internal clips stored on phone need to be outside of DCIM or any default folders. Need to be in their own folder at start of Root. Otherwise will not send to Premiere

- Video Clips will need to be 5 minutes under 1 Gb to send to premiere. Before edits are done needs to be within these parameters. You will be able to sync to Cloud, & add to project, but will not be able to Send to Premiere. 

- When importing clips from Creative Cloud. Their is no way of having them be added to the timeline in the order you choose. You will need to import and sort. Or import one by one.

- If you are getting a generic error when sending Adobe Clip project to Premiere. Then you need to give permission for local storage on your phone and send again. 

That is all, i am done. Hopefully Adobe Rush comes to Android or at least the Galaxy S10. And resolves all of these issues.

Let's talk about Captivate,3,85oxkn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Adobe/comments/85oxkn/lets_talk_about_captivate/,3,1521537821.0,"Or, how is this product so utterly unreliable and limited compared to other Adobe products? 

For those unfamiliar, Adobe Captivate is a hatechild conceived by Flash and Powerpoint while SnagIt recorded in the corner. Later on it mainlined HTML5 droppings in a vain attempt at web compliance. 

I love every other Adobe product (okay, maybe not the Ink and Slide), and have worked with other troublesome acquisitions (AEM, anyone?), but those were at least new to the lineup. Captivate has been around for years and continues to function like a relic. One could argue that it's a specialized tool for a unique task, but it doesn't even perform that task reliably. 

Perhaps it's the managers who expect to reach the moon in an AMC Gremilin, or it's exporting a project to HTML5 for the tenth time and still having a nonfunctional widget. Maybe it's that formatting and other basic attributes break once the slide count gets too high, but I was overjoyed to leave e-learning behind and refuse to ever touch Captivate again in my career. Designers, developers, and skilled professionals should stay well away from this product.

The support community is abundant with pompous 'mvp's who jealously defend a flawed product and immediately blame the user for having a legitimate complaint. Responses are usually one of three types:

Condescending: ""You don't know how to make custom JavaScript play nice with our proprietary layer to perform a function that should be in the program in the first place? Tut tut.""

Shameless: ""I think it's a great product. I get a hearty chub when I fire Captivate up. I'd call my wife over to handle it but I'm married to e-learning"" 

Those Darn Kids: ""In my day we had to stitch together corn husks if we wanted to embed custom flash objects. Some people always complain. Bad craftsmen blame the tool.""
 
Right, because the tool works great if you hit yourself in the balls with it three times. Other tools make you smash your huevos five times. That's progress. 

Maybe I'm an entitled millennial who spits out his avocado toast and kombucha at the thought real work. Maybe aging e-learning professionals have lost touch with what makes a decent product and compensate with smugness. I maintain that faulty software has never been acceptable, particularly when it's 2018 and a company is charging $360 a year for it. ",2018-03-20 04:23:41

Possibly the worst customer service ever,3,69hyr9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Adobe/comments/69hyr9/possibly_the_worst_customer_service_ever/,0,1494054060.0,"So, a week ago last Friday (April 28th), I saw that my bank account had a negative balance of 600 bucks.  I looked and saw a charge for $644 from Adobe for CC.  Now, I had cancelled my subscription a year ago, so this was a little suspicious.

I work nights, so when I got home early in the morning, phone support wasn't available.  I got on the support chat and explained the problem.  They saw that I had cancelled, and issued a refund they said would take 5-7 days.  Now, that $644 had put my bank account into the negative, even though I had just been paid as well, however the bank temporarily gave access to the funds so I was able to withdraw some cash to live off of.

I called again last Tuesday because while investigating my bank account, I saw that they had also charged me last year for an auto-renewal.  They were able to issue a credit for that as well, though I have yet to see it in my bank account.  I also still hadn't seen the refund for the $644, and was getting bad check charges.  I asked if they could get in touch with their bank to speed up the process.

It is now a week later, and I haven't seen the refund.  I called again today, and they said the refund was issued on the 2nd (when I had called the second time), and that it ""posted"" on the 3rd.  I've called my bank, and they see no record of any refund activity.

On my first call today, it got ""escalated"" to a ""floor manager"" who said he'd call me back in a half hour after talking to their accounting.  He also said he was located in Seattle at Adobe.  He spoke with an Indian accent.  I never got a call back, and tried to e-mail him.  The e-mail I got from him (and checked phonetically) bounced.  When I called back, I was told they weren't in India and there were 4000 people there and they had never seen this e-mail address before.

When I called back, I got escalated to a supervisor who could find no record in their call logs of anyone similarly named, so I had to explain from scratch again.  This idiot literally had me call my bank on the cell phone so I could confirm to him that the bank had no record of any transaction.  Throughout the whole call, he insisted that there system showed the refund had been issued.

I'll be having the bank deal with this at this point, however this was by far the worst customer service I've experienced from any company.",2017-05-06 02:01:00

Am I imagining how sneaky this is?,3,5p5vto,https://www.reddit.com/r/Adobe/comments/5p5vto/am_i_imagining_how_sneaky_this_is/,3,1484967842.0,"I paid for an annual student Creative Cloud, month-to-month, Adobe subscription for a year. Even though I received no email stating I would have a renewal soon, thought ""I should check on that and cancel it.""

Apparently the renewal happened 3 days ago. 

Here's the quote from their subscription Terms and Conditions:
(http://www.adobe.com/misc/subscription_terms.html)

**Your contract will renew automatically, on your annual renewal date, until you cancel. Renewal rates are subject to change, but we’ll always notify you beforehand. If you cancel within 14 days of your order, you’ll be fully refunded. Should you cancel after 14 days, you’ll be charged 50% of your remaining contract obligation and your service will continue until the end of that month’s billing period.**

According to Adobe, the 14 days only applies to the first purchase order, which I paid 1y 3d ago. But this is my reasoning in interpreting those Terms:

1. My contract obligation for my first year was Jan 17, 2016, 1y 3d ago.
2. ""Should you cancel after 14 days, you’ll be charged 50% of your *remaining contract obligation*."" (emphasis mine)
3. My remaining contract obligation for 1-17-16 ended 3 days ago.
4. A NEW contract obligation began 3 days ago.
5. By the wording, the 14 days grace is attached to each contract *obligation* (obligation = 1 yr)

Is that not right? New annual contracts = new purchase = refund policy applies? At the very least, a notification email should be sent. All of my other subscription services are upfront about upcoming charges and warn me days in advance.

Anyway, I understand that I have responsibility when I sign up accepting certain Terms and Conditions, and it's my responsibility to keep up with subscriptions. I just feel like it was really sneaky of them to not include that cancellation refund policies don't apply for subsequent years, when in my experience other companies with auto-renewals like Amazon Prime *do* allow refunds within days of a renewal. If they'd stated that in their terms, I would have been much more diligent about keeping track of the exact day.

It's not that I believe Adobe is violating their own Terms and Conditions, or that Adobe is wrong, it's just that they were not clear and they're ok with that because sometimes it helps them make money.

Correct me if I'm wrong.",2017-01-20 21:04:02

The bigger issue is that I have now opened 4 support tickets with Adobe who tells me they cannot help unless they have remote access to my computer which I've given them all four times eating up hours and hours of my time. This has been going on for MONTHS and now they want remote access again. I told them I am not giving it to them until they offer some sort of compensation for my time. They offered me 2 images which is an insult.

I have been more than patient with them. I have given them everything they need and every single time they drop the ball and then want to repeat everything again.

"Please be aware guys, could cost you a lot of money!",3,5l65fb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Adobe/comments/5l65fb/please_be_aware_guys_could_cost_you_a_lot_of_money/,3,1483164509.0,"Hi guys, just cancelled my subscription plan. Turns out there is a clause in the terms and conditions which states that your subscription will be renewed automatically as a year has went by since you started the subscription. Now Im being charged 200$ for cancelling the subscription, and my one year contract ended in late november 2016. Still they would not cut me some slack, and Im being charged. The best part about it: They wanted me to renew my subscription, in order for me to just get a chance of having my case reviewed by higher divisions. The lesson I learned: Always read terms and conditions, no matter how many fucking pages you have to go through.

Here's a transcription of the conversation, thought is was funny: 

info: Thank you for your patience. Your wait time is approximately  '0' minutes.

info: You are now chatting with another one of our shitty employers!

Worker: Thank you for contacting Adobe Membership Services . I’ll look into your account right away to view exclusive offers for your membership.

Me: I just cancelled my teacher/student edition subscription. And I got informed that was feed a cancelation fee of x amount. Even though I only have a one year subscription. I started my subscription back in november 2015, so I have went past my legally binding of one year. Therefore I should not be charged, if I understand correctly? I just need a confirmation that I will not get the cancelation fee. (?)

Worker: Ok.

Worker: could you please confirm your registered phone no. with Adobe?

me: yeah

me: ................

Me: Adobecaneatabucketofdicks@gmail.com is my email.

Worker: Thank for confirming me the details.

Worker: Please allow me 1-2 minutes while i am reviewing your account details.

Me: No problem.

Worker: I understand your concern but cancellation fee can't be waive off.

Me: All right, could you please provide me with the reasons?

Worker: Sure.

Worker: I would like to inform that you agreed to be in a yearly commitment, if you cancel the subscription within the commitment period, there is an Early Termination Fee which amounts to 50% of the remaining months. This fee is as per the contract you agreed to at the time of purchase and was mentioned in the terms and conditions as well.

me: Which is why Im telling you that I agreed to the contract and had my first payment november 2015. Well as of today we're in desember 2016, last time I checked that was just about over a period of one year.

Me: So please, inform me. What do I not understand in this case?

Me: I've sent you screenshots from my full billing period

Worker: as per the Adobe policy term and condition remain during the 2 year also.

Worker: And if you didn't want to renew for another year you were suppose to contact us before your next renewal date.

Worker: We do send out auto renewal emails in the 11th month to the email address registered with Adobe. There can be a slight possibility that the email might have gone to your Junk or the Spam folder. There could be another possibility that your email security policy deleted the email considering it to be spam as it comes from an automated email address from Adobe. Since you agreed to be in a commitment, if you cancel the subscription within the commitment period, there is an Early Termination Fee which amounts to 50% of the remaining months. This fee is as per the contract you agreed to at the time of purchase and was mentioned in the terms and conditions as well. You may refer to the link (Agent to provide the link to the customer and request the customer to review it). As this is a Subscription model and under a commitment, it’s highly recommended to complete the tenure before cancellation because the subscription renew automatically unless you cancel it.

Me: All right, so what you are trying to say here is that because i 'agreed' to a renewal in november 2015, I agreed to a 2 year of subscription?

Me: november 2016*

Me: sorry

Worker: as per the Adobe policy plan gets auto-renew untill unless you don't cancel it.

Worker: And during the 2 nd year also term and condition remain same.

Worker: So,we can't waive off the cancellation fee.

me: That's really sneaky tactics, me and probably thousands of people feel stupid as hell for not reading through all of your sneaky articles in your terms and conditions. This is not a good development for Adobe, if you ask me. With all your respect, it's not your fault. But they can take my fucking money. Im never coming back, this is ridiculous. Once again, not your fault. But give your CEO a good kick in the ass from me when you see him/her. Have a nice day, hope mye 200 $ is spent well.

Me: Disgraceful.

Worker: .......,i understand that but if you don't wanted to pay for cancellation you were suppose to contact us might be at that we could help with some exceptions.

Me: I understand that, which is why I contacted you before I got transferred

Worker: But As you have already cancelled it nothing can be done on this.

Worker: Ok

Worker: Kindly get your case no blank for this chat.

Worker: Is there anything else i can help you with?

Me: As i wrote to the last guy, it was a miss click by me as I were chatting with the other dude. I understand that I have 'lost', and that there is probably nothing you can help me with. Since im fucking stupid for not taking my time to read all of your terms and conditions as every fucking human on planet earth normally does.

Worker: i understand that what can done now is you can take same plan on different email.

Worker: Or you can get back to us after -----.2017 and purchase new order on same email.

Worker: Then will be able to escalate this for cancelation refund to our next level.

Me: But I understand that you guys operate the way you do. By putting a bunch of terms of conditions regarding your customers you'll always have the jurisdiction on your side. And therefore have a 'shield' for whenever an unhappy customer puts it's head up, and I get that. That is the times we live in. However, I was hoping that you guys would cut me some slack, considering Im only one month late with my cancellation. I was hoping for some humanly help, rather than legally binding words. And just to say it dude, Im not angy at you. I've worked at customer service myself. It's just that we at some cases would cut the customers some slack, in order to keep them for the future through by providing them extensive service. Which is an policy Adobe clearly does not stand by. At least as Im sitting here now typing this.

Worker: I understand that what can done now is you can take same plan on different email.Or you can get back to us after ----.2017 and purchase new order on same email.

Worker: This can be done on this case.

Worker: I have already discussed you case with my resources.

Worker: But we are unable to do anything more about it.

Me: All right, I'll come back ---- in hopes for a refund. So just to be clear, I wait to ---- and then renew the subscription, and then contact customer service once again?

Me: I need some written confirmation so I don't get caught in the 'jurdisdic web' again. Im on full alert with Adobe now, haha :)

Worker: Yes,you need to repurchase it on same email then after ----2017 you get back to us we'll be able to escalate it our next level for refund.

Me: Cool

Worker: This is your case no.------ for the same./

Worker: Ypu will get this chat copy over the email also.

me: I appreciate you for going out of your ways and providing me with an alternative. Just one question. I have allready canceled, wouldn't I commit to another year if I renew my subscription again? And therefore risking an even higher cancelation fee?

Worker: i am sorry but it will be committed plan with same term and condition.

Me: Thats what I thought. So basically Im 'risking' paying even more money in order to just get the chance of having my case evaluated by next level?

Me: You guys are on some next level shit, haha

Worker: I understand but this the option available if you want to be refunded

Worker: Kindly get your case no blank for this chat.

Worker: Is there anything else i can help you with?

Worker: Thank you for contacting Adobe.  We are available 7 days a 
week, 24 hours a day. Goodbye!

Worker: You may receive an email with our Customer Feedback Survey. The survey takes less than 2 minutes and I would really appreciate your feedback.  (Thought you could just run away didn't you?)

Me: I understand that, however i want to be refunded, but there is no guarantee I will be. That's the problem, you are basically asking me if I want to put my money on black or red on the roulette. Im gonna leave you alone, you seem like a nice person.

Me: Have a nice day dude, I'll see what I end up doing.

Worker: ........., i understand your concern but i apologize adobe system is design in such way.

Worker: Is there anything else i can help you with?

Me: No problem, I understand that it's a system you have no controll over. We had the same thing in the company I worked at customer service for. So I get where you're from! No dude, it seems like you have gone out of your way and done the best you could for me. I appreciate that!

Worker: Are we still conncted

Me: yes we are 

Worker: Ok.

Worker: ......,Thank you.

LPT: C Drive suddenly full? Check Adobe's AppData folder,3,5em0f9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Adobe/comments/5em0f9/lpt_c_drive_suddenly_full_check_adobes_appdata/,0,1479992637.0,"TL;DR Use Adobe's Cleaning function in Edit->Preferences->Media tab of any Adobe software to clear out a bloated AppData folder on PCs.

Passing this along since I just discovered it myself. I lent a friend of mine my laptop so she could do some editing. She returned it saying that because my C drive was full, Premiere would crash and she couldn't get anything done. I was flabbergasted, since this was a new laptop and I hadn't put 200 GB worth of files on it in just a few months. 

I checked my computer folder by folder to see where the huge influx of files was coming from. It took revealing ""hidden"" folders using Control Panel to see that AppData was the source, at 172 GB in size. This folder contains essential data for many programs in Windows, and isn't often cleaned by DiskCheck (which I had already run, to no avail). Deleting these files willy-nilly can lead to broken programs or an inoperable computer, so I tread with caution. Another search showed that Adobe was the main offender, with a total folder size of 163 GB. Yikes!

Not wanting to destroy my files, I turned to the internet, where I found [this forum post](http://help.adobe.com/en_US/AfterEffects/9.0/WSEF6D619D-DFA4-467f-AD1A-280C81A19D77.html) that was quite helpful. Turns out Adobe makes little caches of media files to make editing video easier. But, when you make a lot of files very quickly without deleting them, you get bloat. This was what was bogging down my computer.

To fix the problem, I followed the website's instructions, which I'll quote here:

>Choose Edit > Preferences > Media & Disk Cache (Windows) or After Effects > Preferences > Media & Disk Cache (Mac OS), and do one of the following:
>Click one of the Choose Folder buttons to change the location of the media cache database or the media cache itself.
>Click Clean Database & Cache to remove conformed and indexed files from the cache and to remove their entries from the database. This command only removes files associated with footage items for which the source file is no longer available.

And that was that - my folder went down to maybe 1 GB and my laptop is running smoothly. Hope this helps someone else who may have the same problem in the future!",2016-11-24 07:03:57
Premiere and Speedgrade - need help,3,5d8p6y,https://www.reddit.com/r/Adobe/comments/5d8p6y/premiere_and_speedgrade_need_help/,0,1479324207.0,"Hello all,
So I've learned that ever since Premiere Pro got upgraded, it doesn't work in Dynamic Link with Speedgrade anymore. Why Adobe would keep doing this kind of thing is beyond me. Fact is that I need Sg's auto-grade functonality to quickly appropriate a few clips' color settings to match others. It's very important and I don't have the budget (or the will) to purchase other solutions after paying for a complete creative package for professoinals.

I found the converter tool that has been discussed here. It did convert the file to one that works in Sg, yet all clips just show ""media offline"" and I couldn't find a way to re-link. They work perfectly in Premiere.

Any idea how to solve this...? Thanks so much!",2016-11-16 13:23:27

Is there a way in which I can see some metrics, either from CC administration interface (If it even exists) for their usage? With a break down of what parts of the Creative Cloud suit they use. 

If user X only uses Photoshop + Illustrator once every 2 weeks we could easily assign each user  seats for the users and save some money.

Acrobat Reader Pro DC (2019.021.20061) not remembering Signature & Initials,2,esom3g,https://www.reddit.com/r/Adobe/comments/esom3g/acrobat_reader_pro_dc_201902120061_not/,0,1579785722.0,"I'm using the latest version of Adobe Acrobat Reader Pro DC  (2019.021.20061) on MacOS Catalina and am facing a problem with Reader not saving Initial  and Signature under ""Fill and Sign"".

For the past several  years, I have been using the Fill and Sign tool to put my signature and  stamp on PDF documents. I would open the PDF file, click on the Fill and  Sign button in the toolbar and then my signature and stamp (under  initial) would be there. Now however both Signature and Initial shows an  empty button with Add Signature/Add Initial and a + sign. When I click  the + sign to add my signature jpg and stamp jpg again, the screen to  choose the sign/draw/image tab. I select the Image tab and a File select  window pops up. I select the .jpg file for my signature/stamp and click  on Apply. The signature/stamp shows up in my document as expected.  However, when I click the Fill and Sign button in the toolbar again  (even without closing the pdf file), the signature / stamp have  disappeared again and I have to again go through the process of clicking  +, File, select the .jpg file, etc. Yes, the checkbox for ""Save  Signature"" or ""Save Initials"" is checked.

Fixed “Video Module” Error on Premiere Pro 2020 on startup. (MAC),2,ej3ncz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Adobe/comments/ej3ncz/fixed_video_module_error_on_premiere_pro_2020_on/,1,1578025340.0,"My specs: 
Mid 2014 imac / 32GB ram / AMD card 
OS Mojave 

Ok, PP 2020 and AE 2020 have both been giving me problems. 

On PP I kept getting the “video module” error on startup of program.  It would randomly work after comp restart. Annoying af. 

On AE my compositions wouldn’t show up in the viewer window. 

Finally called Adobe, here’s what I learned: 

1. Adobe knows the video module error is happening with some users. 

2. Adobe has some sort of tool that can allow 2020 projects to be opened in 2019 PP. 

3. Adobe remote controlled my comp and took my plugins out of the public folder. (Copied to desktop) I use trapcode Tao and another one, though just for AE. Don’t use them for PP. 

4. After removing the plugins PP 2020 started fine. Didn’t have to downgrade file to 2019 PP. 

5. AE now works as well. 

6. I had already reinstalled 2020 and reset the plugins cashe and preferences though that did not work. 

7. Adobe said they’re working on an update to next ver of 2020 that fixes the video module error. 

So try removing plugins from your public folder. Don’t remember where they were, I think Library / Application Support / Adobe 7.0 folder.. you might have to look that up to confirm. 

If this helps one person that would be awesome. Spent 2 days trying all the recommendations online that I could find.
