1. digital media usage is driven by mobile apps ($53.4B will be spent on in-app ads by 2020)
2. marketers need to understand multichannel audience targeting
3. mobile native ads provide the best user experience (Native ads will make up over half of ad spend this year)
4. the IAB universal measurement SDK to reduce pub latency issues
5. Supply Path Optimization = getting the lowest CPM, at the lowest fees, and best access, to get the best eCPM

MediaMath's ground-breaking new paper on causal ad-effectiveness measurement,6,697id8,https://www.reddit.com/r/adtech/comments/697id8/mediamaths_groundbreaking_new_paper_on_causal/,0,1493933565.0,"https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.00634

Abstract:

The problem of measuring the true incremental effectiveness of a digital advertising campaign is of increasing importance to marketers. With a large and increasing percentage of digital advertising delivered via Demand-Side-Platforms (DSPs) executing campaigns via Real-Time-Bidding (RTB) auctions and programmatic approaches, a measurement solution that satisfies both advertiser concerns and the constraints of a DSP is of particular interest. 

MediaMath (a DSP) has developed the first practical, statistically sound randomization-based methodology for causal ad effectiveness (or Ad Lift) measurement by a DSP (or similar digital advertising execution system that may not have full control over the advertising transaction mechanisms). We describe our solution and establish its soundness within the causal framework of counterfactuals and potential outcomes, and present a Gibbs-sampling procedure for estimating confidence intervals around the estimated Ad Lift. We also address practical complications (unique to the digital advertising setting) that stem from the fact that digital advertising is targeted and measured via identifiers (e.g., cookies, mobile advertising IDs) that may not be stable over time. One such complication is the repeated occurrence of identifiers, leading to interference among observations. Another is due to the possibility of multiple identifiers being associated with the same consumer, leading to ""contamination"" with some of their identifiers being assigned to the Treatment group and others to the Control group. Complications such as these have severely impaired previous efforts to derive accurate measurements of lift in practice. 

In contrast to a few other papers on the subject, this paper has an expository aim as well, and provides a rigorous, self-contained, and readily-implementable treatment of all relevant concepts."

New to adtech,5,bggiv4,https://www.reddit.com/r/adtech/comments/bggiv4/new_to_adtech/,3,1556055731.0,"Hi, I just recently scored a position as account manager and business developer at an ad exchange. I previously had a couple of years of experience working at an ad network on CPI campaigns, the ad buying was almost always just rebrokered network traffic and most of the time I was dealing with direct advertisers. So in this new position I will be working on CPM campaigns and dealing with SSPs, DSPs and other adexchanges. I would like to ask for the people that are more experienced if you could recommend some books or websites where I can learn more about ad exchanges, integrations (endpoints, adm tags, vocabulary) and also what I should expect in this industry, I think the crucial point of my job will be onboarding new demand to the exchange, so if you have any tip you can share, I would greatly appreciate!"

So, GPT provides a function in its API *getResponseInformation()* that can be used to get info about the loaded ad such as *lineItemId*, advertiserId, campaignId, creativeId, etc. This function when used in tandem with the *SlotRenderEndedEvent* is very useful. However, as far as I know, this is only available for non amp ads.  


I'm trying to find a similar function for AMP ads. Does anyone know of any such feature that AMP offers with which I can get atleast the lineItemId of the loaded ad?

Any consent string / TCF experts here? Need help understanding flows,2,dw24b9,https://www.reddit.com/r/adtech/comments/dw24b9/any_consent_string_tcf_experts_here_need_help/,2,1573724115.0,"Hi All,

I've read all of IAB's documentation, and dozens of other websites, but still need help pulling together a complete picture of how consent is created and flows through the adtech ecosystem.  If it helps, assume we're talking solely about TCF 2.0, and assume we're talking about browsers only.  And assume that I'm using the words ""consent string"" and ""daisy bit"" interchangeably.  

**I think it goes something like this**:  

1. User loads a web page.  A consent banner is generated, and if the user clicks into the site, the user is assumed to have given consent to the collection and processing of data.  
2. This consent is recorded by the site's consent management platform (CMP), and is stored on CMP servers (and keyed together via a user cookie set by the CMP).  The consent captures the permission obtained by the site, for the user, and includes permissions for each individual adtech vendor.  The consent can later be retrieved via the CMP API.  
3. The website (publisher) sends out an ad request.  The ad request contains the consent string.  \[Presumably they've retrieved it from the CMP.\] 

**This is where I start to get confused, and here are \[some of\] my questions**:  

1. When a page loads, dozens of pixel/cookie/data sync requests are sent out.  How do they know what is in the consent string?  Where do they get the information?  (E.g., they call the CMP API, or the pub gives it to them via some method?) 
2. Do the vendors conducting these sync requests also have to share the daisy bit to the vendors with whom they are syncing?  If so, are they passing what the publisher gives them, or are they picking it up directly from the CMP?  
3. Should every event downstream of the original ad request or sync request contain the same consent string?  Is it replicated verbatim, or grabbed anew with each event?  
4. If the permission for a specific vendor is NO in the consent string, is the vendor expected NOT to initiate any further data syncs and NOT to drop any further cookies?  
5. Bonus points:  have you ever seen a company manipulate a consent string, and if so, what happened?  

I'd be thrilled if there were some sort of data flow or process diagram on the interwebs, but I'm not finding one.  

Any help here -- even partial answers -- are most welcome.  

Thanks."
Question regarding user sync pixels and header bidding,2,czgxzx,https://www.reddit.com/r/adtech/comments/czgxzx/question_regarding_user_sync_pixels_and_header/,2,1567606216.0,"Hi. I'm working at a medium sized adtech company where we provide a header bidding solution for our clients. I've seen several pages recently where the publisher is fetching user sync cookies at page load, before any bids are sent (prebid.js). Is there any real benefit to this? We fire user sync cookies currently after the bid process has run (or at the same time as rendering the ad, basically).

What I'm after is any clarity in to the timing for user-sync pixels to be fired. Thanks!"

The requirements look like a lot of bloat, so seeking some clarification as to why I need to include like 20+ libraries just to retrieve and display an ad from a server. I'm OK with just moving on, but I do want to get full understanding so I'm not glossing over anything. 

For the more technical.. 

MoPub and A9 SDKs both require a whole crapton of frameworks that look wholly unnecessary that I feel like can be removed/ignored. Probably the same goes for AdMob / DFP, though I'm still junior and learning more about these. 

Mediaplayer, CoreTelephony as an example. Ads (VAST, MRAID, etc) don't have MediaPlayer as a dependency from my understanding last I checked. And I certainly don't need to know about who the user called unless I have malicious intent. 

If I'm just showing an ad, the most I'd really require is maybe the CoreLocation framework. I work closely with another ad network that at most has WebKit.framework and libxml2.2.tbd that need to be included, which seem fair. 

Can somebody help me understand why these might all be 'required' to operate these larger Ad SDKs?

Just curious since I like to keep things minimal and not include them if I don't need really need them. 

If this is the wrong place, can you let me know where would be better? I can post this to IOSdev as well but I figured there was a business case for why these would all be included. "

For Immediate Release

Bitmedia.io ups fraud detection abilities, researching decentralised blockchain applications for ad sector
Major update to BitMedia Bitcoin denominated Advertising Platform deployed giving advertisers click and impression traffic quality confidence by default

Bitmedia.io, the EU based bitcoin advertising network, announces the deployment of upgraded anti-fraud technology into their ad server, an upgraded ad management system, and improved traffic quality control tools. This major upgrade gives cryptocurrency advertisers looking to target the sector increased confidence across CPM and CPC campaigns. As the industry evolves to become more centralised and regulated, marketing and finance staff and their media buyers across the world require more reliance over how and where their funds are being spent in an environment where less than half of impressions on advertising networks can be served to non-human and fraudulent traffic sources. 

This week’s upgrade empowers advertisers with an upgraded self-service ad management system featuring brand new traffic quality and control tools. It also paves the way for the  introduction of non-cryptocurrency payment options later in the year. By partnering with Enbrite.ly and others, the Bitmedia.io platform adds advanced impression and click level fraud-detection for advertisers by default, saving the need to advertisers to pay for this separately to monitor campaigns run on the network.

Bitmedia aims to enable advertisers to have a deregulated platform with advanced traffic and quality control tools, and is using its $100,000 investment secured last year into researching different approaches where the blockchain can solve problems within the advertising industry. They are particularly focusing on blockchain applications for providing tamper-proof advertising data.

Since launching in 2014, Bitmedia.io has signed up over 2,000 specialist bitcoin publishers across the web, and have attracted over 600 advertisers to the network. These include Betcoin.tm who stated “The interface, conversion rates and overall value are superior to other networks”  and PlusBitcoin who stated “BitMedia provides the best targeting options, good user experience and great reports”

Advertisers or media buyers interested in running campaigns on bitmedia can sign up at https://bitmedia.io/bitcoin-advertising, with deposits credited after 3 confirmations. BitMedia offers instant bonuses for new and existing advertisers. The bonus size depends on the topup amount. Bitcoin Publishers can sign up at https://bitmedia.io or you can follow BitMedia at  https://www.facebook.com/bitmedia.io and https://twitter.com/bitmedia_io

Quick question - what are you doing to get ahead of the CCPA/GDPR laws that are taking effect on December 31? It's my understanding that they are going to cause some serious unrest in the industry, especially the migration from Google DCM to Ads Data Hub? Any advice on how a data consultancy can get out ahead of this issue? Trying to be as prepared as possible when the time comes.

More specifically, I'm looking to understand the following:

1. Will multichannel attribution even be an option after December 31? If so, what steps do I need to take so that I can accurately model across Facebook, Google, Tradedesk, etc.
2. How are agencies getting ready to adjust frequency optimization? Without insight into how many ads a specific user was targeted with, it seems to me as if agencies and brands are losing a lot of transparency here. Is there a good workaround?"

Top 5 Big Data Challenges Every AdTech Startup May Meet and the Ways to Overcome Them,1,bueilq,https://www.reddit.com/r/adtech/comments/bueilq/top_5_big_data_challenges_every_adtech_startup/,2,1559164368.0,"In recent years, the advertising technology market has made a big leap. Digital marketing has evolved into data-driven marketing. Using big data, you can create effective campaigns, conduct communication with customers, and come to them precisely once the desire for a product or service breaks out.

The advertising tools ecosystem along with the approaches and processes used with it form a technology called adtech. Therefore, big data projects have clearly become a usual thing in adtech, although it doesn’t make big data simple.

Let’s try to highlight some adtech technical problems that a startup has to solve to gain success:

* develop a product that can be easily scaled in line with the increasing workloads and data volumes that should be stored
* integrate with third-party services to attract new users and segments
* identify users for targeted advertising without violating the regulations
* aggregate analytics in a timely manner, often in real time
* ensure the safety of any personal user data that may be available to the system

Under these points, we can see challenges that most likely each adtech startup will face in a way. If you have a feeling that you are ready to acknowledge and even conquer them hop on [here](https://blog.s-pro.io/top-5-big-data-challenges-every-adtech-startup-may-meet/) to get insights!

How do I find people who wants to advertise through my websites?,1,7bz8z6,https://www.reddit.com/r/adtech/comments/7bz8z6/how_do_i_find_people_who_wants_to_advertise/,0,1510321699.0,"Apologies for a rather vague title. I wasn't too sure how to word it. 

Anyway, so here's my situation.

I have a product. My product allows users to create content sites (similar to reddit perhaps?) My users want to earn money by advertising. They want my product to handle the advertising and are happy for me to take a cut.

Now every website created is different and contains different types of contents.

Is there an advertising platform that I can sign up and place ads on websites programmatically via API (perhaps give keywords to get relevant ads maybe) and then monitor the clicks and money earned through API as well, so I can report that back to my users to show how much their website earned each month?

I've looked at a lot of ad platform out there (e.g. Rakuten, Chitika etc), but wasn't sure exactly where to look.

Does such a thing exist? Can you please point me to the right direction?"

https://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/309715/pg-ad-strategy-bounces-back-after-cutting-out-sit.htm

Today P&G said they are going to double down on advertising after limiting the reach of their ad placements. Ok this makes sense, find sites that work and double down on then. 

But how do they actually do this? Is this something they monitor in their, for example, Google Adwords and then use Google Display to pick and choose their sites? 

I am just missing the piece on how they measured each site's success and then what service they used to select their list of sites to run on.

I know Google Display allows you to select sites but can you get this granular?

Thank you in advance for any guidance. I feel like this is a probably a super dumb question but once I know the answer, it will all make sense.
