Case study: 8 LinkedIn tactics that really worked for us—and 5 that didn't,137,c0avgm,https://www.reddit.com/r/content_marketing/comments/c0avgm/case_study_8_linkedin_tactics_that_really_worked/,45,1560486120.0,"About a year ago, **my boss suggested that we concentrate our b2b content marketing efforts on LinkedIn**. Since the social network was just transforming into a powerful content platform, the suggestion seemed more or less logical, so I had no objections though I didn't know anything about the platform—neither as a user, nor as a content marketer. 

Of course, like other managers, I had a profile on LinkedIn, but almost never logged in on the website. Practice makes perfect, I said to myself. **How different can it be from things I do know like Facebook or Instagram?** Let’s start something—and will figure it out by trial and error. 

Now our reach on LinkedIn amounts to around 100,000 views a day and we have zillions of followers.... If you expect to read something like that after such a preface, you are better off reading something else. This isn't a post that promises miracles—and ends with a link to a 399-dollar ""course on content marketing on LinkedIn."" 

We did achieve some solid results that have made LinkedIn the key element of our content marketing strategy, and my goal here is simply **to share what we've learned so far** and maybe inspire you to share your insights in turn.

## 1. Building CEO's profile instead of the brand's—WORKS!

I noticed that many company pages on LinkedIn with tens of thousands of followers get only a few likes on their posts. At the same time, some ordinary guy from Mississippi with only a thousand followers can enjoy a ten times higher engagement rate. 

This makes sense: **social media are about people, not about brands**. So from day one, I decided to focus on growing the CEO/founder's profile instead of the company's. This was a right choice: in a few weeks, we already saw dozens of likes and thousands views on his updates.

## 2. Growing your network through professional groups—WORKS!

A year ago, the CEO had a network that was pretty random and outdated. So under his account, I joined a few groups of professionals and started sending out invitations to connect. 

Every day, I would go through the list of the group's members and add 10-20 new contacts. This was bothersome, but necessary at the beginning. Soon, LinkedIn started suggesting relevant contacts by itself, and I could opt out of this practice.

## 3. Sending out personal invites—WORKS! (kind of)

LinkedIn encourages its users to send personal notes with invitations to connect. I tried doing that, but soon found this practice too time-consuming. As a founder of 200-million fast-growing brand, the CEO already saw a pretty impressive response rate. I suppose many people added him to their network hoping to land a job one day. 

What I found more practical in the end was **sending a personal message to the most promising contacts AFTER they have agreed to connect**. This way I could be sure that our efforts weren't in vain. People we reached out personally tended to become more engaged. I also suspect that when it comes to your feed, LinkedIn prioritize updates from contacts you talked to.

## 4. Keeping the account authentic—WORKS!

I believe in authenticity: it is crucial on social media. So from the get-go, we decided not to write anything FOR the CEO. He is pretty active on other platforms where he writes in his native language. 

We pick his best content, adapt it to the global audience, translate in English and publish. I can't prove it, but I'm sure this approach contributed greatly to the increase of engagement on his LinkedIn account. People see that his stuff is real.

## 5. Using the CEO account to promote other accounts—WORKS!

The problem with this approach is that I can't manage my boss. If he is swamped or just doesn't feel like writing, we have zero content—and zero reach. Luckily, we can still use his ""likes."" 

Today, **LinkedIn is a unique platform—like Facebook in its early years**. When somebody in your network likes a post, you see this post in your feed even if you aren't connected with its author. 

So we started producing content for our top managers and saw almost the same engagement as with the CEO's own posts because we could reach the entire CEO's network through his ""likes"" on their posts!

## 6. Publishing video content—DOESN'T WORK

I read million times that video content is killing it on social media and every brand should incorporate videos in its content strategy. We tried various types of video posts but rarely managed to achieve satisfying results. 

With some posts our reach was higher than the average but still, it couldn't justify the effort (making even home-made-style videos is much more time-consuming than writings posts).

## 7. Leveraging slideshows—WORKS! (like hell)

We found the best performing type of LinkedIn content almost by accident. As many companies do, we make lots of slideshows, and some of them are pretty decent, with tons of data, graphs, quotes, and nice images. Once, we posted one of such slideshow as PDF—and its reach skyrocketed! 

It wasn't actually an accident—**every time we posted a slideshow  the results were much better than our average reach**. We even started creating slideshows specifically for LinkedIn—with bigger fonts so users could read the presentation right in the feed, without downloading it or making it full-screen.

## 8. Adding links to the slideshows—DOESN'T WORK

I tried to push the slideshow thing even further and started adding links to our presentations. My thinking was that somebody do prefer to download and see them as PDFs—in this case, links would be clickable. Also, I made shortened urls, so they were fairly easy to be typed in. 

Nobody used these urls in reality.

## 9. Driving traffic to a webpage—DOESN'T WORK

Every day I see people who just post links on LinkedIn and hope that it would drive traffic to their websites. I doubt it works. **Any social network punishes those users who try to lure people out of the platform.** Posts with links will never perform nearly as well as posts without them. This rule stays true on LinkedIn. 

I tried different ways of adding links—as a shortlink, natively, in comments... It didn't make any difference and I couldn't turn LinkedIn into a decent source of traffic for our own webpages. 

On top of how algorithms work, **I do think that people simply don't want to click on anything in general**, they WANT to stay on LinkedIn.

## 10. Publishing content as LinkedIn articles—DOESN'T WORK

LinkedIn limits the size of text you can publish as a general update. Everything that exceeds the limit of 1300 characters should be posted as an ""article."" 

I expected the network to promote this type of content (since you put so much effort into writing a long-form post). In reality articles tended to have as bad a reach/engagement as posts with external links. So we stopped publishing any content in the form of articles. 

**It's better to keep updates under the 1300 character limit**. When it's not possible, adding links makes more sense—at least you'll drive some traffic to your website. Yes, I saw articles with lots of likes/comments but couldn't figure out how some people managed to achieve such results.

## 11. Growing your network through your network—WORKS!

When you secure a certain level of reach, you can start expanding your network ""organically""—through your existing network. Every day I go through the likes and comments on our updates and send invitations to the people who are 

1) from the CEO's 2nd/3d circle and 

2) fit our target audience. 

**Since they just engaged with our content, the chances that they'll respond to an invite from the CEO are pretty high.** Every day, I also review new connections, pick the most promising person (CEOs/founders/consultants) and go through their network to send new invites. LinkedIn even allows you to filter contacts so, for example, you can see people from a certain country (which is quite handy).

## 12. Leveraging hashtags—DOESN'T WORK (yet)

Now and then, I see posts on LinkedIn overstuffed with hashtags and can't wrap my head around why people do that. **So many hashtags decrease readability and also look like a desperate cry for attention**. And most importantly, they simply don't make that much difference. 

I checked all the relevant hashtags in our field and they have only a few hundred followers, sometimes no more than 100 or 200. I still add one or two hashtags to a post occasionally hoping that at some point they might start working. 

For now, LinkedIn isn't Instagram when it comes to hashtags.

## 13. Creating branded hashtags—WORKS (or at least makes sense)

What makes more sense today is to create a few branded hashtags that will allow your followers to see related updates. For example, we've been working on a venture in China, and I add a special hashtag to every post covering this topic.

\---

As of now, t**he CEO has around 2,500 followers**. You might say the number is not that impressive, but I prefer to keep the circle small and engaged. Every follower who sees your update and doesn't engage with it reduces its chances to reach a wider audience. Becoming an account with tens of thousands of connections and a few likes on updates would be sad. 

We're in B2B, and here the quality of your contacts matters as much as the quantity. So among these 2,5000 followers, there are lots of CEOs/founders. And now **our organic reach on LinkedIn varies from 5,000 to 20,000 views a week**. We also receive 25-100 likes on every post. There are lots of people on LI who post constantly but have much more modest numbers. 

We also had a few posts with tens of thousands views, but never managed to rank as the most trending posts on LinkedIn. This is the area I want to investigate. The question is how to pull this off staying true to ourselves and to avoid producing that cheesy content I usually see trending.

&#x200B;

I would appreciate your feedback. I plan on writing more on LinkedIn and b2b content marketing in general, and if you're interested, **PM me your e-mail—I'll add you to my tiny newsletter** so you can receive future updates (and nothing besides that, of course).",2019-06-13 23:22:00

I block out all distractions, make sure all chores are done, and sit at my desk with 2 monitors.  Usually this is at night after I have worked out and taken a shower.   I put on headphones and listen to binaural beats.  

I use one monitor for researching and the other monitor for an open word document.  I then paste and/or write in brainstorming thoughts and content that I want to revolve the content around onto the screen with the word document.  This is the final draft from the start, and I just add everything I paste in below it.  

I then sleep on it and the next day I do the same but work more on condensing the information and writing it out. If I am out of the house, I have an open note file on my phone and if ideas arise, I document them there.  

I will always usually work in the evenings, especially for brainstorming and getting in the creative zone. A lot of the hardcore editing and writing is done during the day.  If deadlines are tight, I try to at least sleep on it one night, but ideally its a couple days to read things over again and again.  

Once I have a solid rough draft, I print it out and edit it, highlight, etc, and then make changes and finalize it.

How I leveraged a 1000 view video to get on ABC news,45,d7bn66,https://www.reddit.com/r/content_marketing/comments/d7bn66/how_i_leveraged_a_1000_view_video_to_get_on_abc/,7,1569107223.0,"Over the past several days I have posted my first and second video on Youtube - shared with my huge starting audience of 32 subscribers. ;) Obviously the start was very slow, but it's been an interesting ride that has ended up with the video making it to the front page of a [1.1M member subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/d6grmn/my_family_of_3s_budget_living_on_65k_salary_in/) and being featured on [ABC nightly news](https://abc7news.com/home/man-raises-a-family-in-the-bay-area-making-$65000-a-year-/5556704/?fbclid=IwAR3VcwqLLGJo8iwFknM6kK0gwX0XAxzFb1AvA_GFeLbRxbJnDDdFKe_IXwo).

I just made a [video going into some detail on how it all transpired](https://youtu.be/eB4dshRfs-s), but thought I'd give you a more detailed breakdown here as I think there may be some takeaways that you could leverage for your own for content marketing.

First off, after spending nearly 20 hours scripting, filming and editing [the original video that I posted to my youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eB4dshRfs-s) I felt euphoria when I finally hit the ""Upload"" button. That euphoria quickly disappointed as a few minutes past and no one had viewed the video - pretty discouraging after having just spent 20 hours making it. Honestly, I've fallen into this trap before and had forgotten that the real work starts the moment you hit ""upload.""  


I'm a firm believer that every piece of content should be treated like it's own ""Product"" and have it's own marketing campaign setup around it. The goal of the campaign should be distribution. Just like a product, you have different channels you can try to get distribution through, with no budget - I had to get creative on how I was going to get noticed.

After posting to my personal Facebook, Twitter, and Linkedin audiences, I took the video to reddit. I didn't just post the video and say ""go watch this,"" instead I wrote out every word I said in the video and put it in the reddit post so people didn't have to go watch it and it didn't seem ""self promoting."" The subreddit it ended up ""popping"" on was /frugal where the message of my post resonated with the community there. I started getting a few comments there right away and was diligently responding to every comment with the hope that I would start a dialog and the Reddit algorithm would reward that engagement. I don't know if that was the key to success on the post, or if it would have happened organically but the post continued to receive attention and through the engagement made it to the front page of the subreddit for the remainder of the day with the end result being +700 karma on my Reddit account. Towards the end of the day, ABC news noticed the Reddit thread and reached out to do a local story as they thought my story would resonate with the local audience in San Francisco (where I am living and what my video was talking about). I called the anchor as soon as I got the chat at 5pm on Thursday and we setup a time to shoot the interview/story on Friday morning.

The ABC story has had ripple effects beyond the distribution of ABC's platform. It has given my video and channel legitimacy, taking me from ""some weirdo sharing his families $65k salary budget breakdown living in SF"" to ""wow, your story is so interesting that even the news picked it up - let me be a part of this movement."" within my own network. 

We'll see where this all goes, but if you've ever produced a piece of content that is still live - it's not too late to put together a marketing plan for it and try to get some distribution.",2019-09-21 18:07:03

Some tips on coming up with ideas for content,41,blzukf,https://www.reddit.com/r/content_marketing/comments/blzukf/some_tips_on_coming_up_with_ideas_for_content/,27,1557311688.0,"Hey everyone,

When I talk to fellow marketers, one challenge that comes up often is coming up with enough content ideas for their blog.

So, I thought I'll share some tips on how I come up with content ideas.

**#1: Do keyword research**

Keyword research is an SEO activity that involves finding the most popular words or phrases your target customers use when searching for what you do.

Once you know what these words or phrases are, you can start creating content (or pages) to rank for them.

First, you have to start with seed keywords. Seed keywords are the foundation of your keyword research. You’ll need them to generate more keyword ideas.

Coming up with an initial seed keyword list is relatively easy. Just grab a pen and paper and start brainstorming using these two questions:

* How would people search for you if they want to find your website (or a website similar to yours)?
* How would people describe your product or service?

Then, with your seed keyword list done, you can expand your list and generate even more keyword ideas. All you have to do is to plug these keywords into your keyword tool of choice.

You can use free tools like AnswerThePublic or KeywordTool, or use a professional keyword tool like Ahrefs. (The database size and accuracy of metrics will differ from free to paid tools).

From there, you can whittle down the list of ideas and prioritize them.

**#2: Lurk in communities**

Communities (like Reddit) are good places to find ideas.

Simply lurk around and see what topics they're discussing. When you find a topic that is a good fit for your blog, you can use Keywords Everywhere (free) or Ahrefs (paid) to see if there are any search volumes behind those topics.

**#3: Content Explorer 'hack'**

Ahrefs' Content Explorer is a search engine with a billion pages in its index.

You can take advantage of its massive index to find low-hanging content ideas.

Enter a broad niche‐relevant keyword, then apply two filters:

* Referring domains between < 5
* Organic traffic filter = 1,000+

The result? Pages that get tons of search traffic while having few or no backlinks.

**#4: Find broken pages and recreate them**

With the live/broken filter in Content Explorer, you can find broken pages by topic within seconds.

Enter any topic into Content Explorer, and set the live/broken filter to ""only broken"". Then add a Referring domains filter of a min. of 50 (or whichever number you prefer).

Voila!

A list of broken pages with tons of backlinks, sorted by topic.

**#5: Find outdated pages and recreate them**

Search Content Explorer for something like “fitness” or “protein,” then filter for pages:

* That are live (not broken)
* That have only been published once
* That were published many years ago
* With 100+ referring domains.

One of the results from Greatist was published in 2016 and it links to many different smoothie recipes from other websites. The problem: some of those links are broken/recipes no longer exist.

So, here’s what you could do:

* Create an up‐to‐date working list of high‐protein smoothie recipes
* Ask anyone linking to the old page to swap out the link in favor of yours

How To Find Blog Sub-topics That Your Target Audience Is Guaranteed To Love,36,8y345o,https://www.reddit.com/r/content_marketing/comments/8y345o/how_to_find_blog_subtopics_that_your_target/,1,1531369820.0,"The fantastic thing about content marketing is the internet has an *endless supply of sub-topics* for your niche. You just need to **know where to find them**. 

Even if you’re unfamiliar with the topic you need to write about, you’ll still have an endless amount of information that you know your target audience will be interested in, provided you follow the following strategies. 

# Use Udemy and have a look at the course material

Udemy hosts thousands of educational digital courses. It’s arguably the home of e-learning. Some of these courses cost money to view, but others are free.

If an industry expert has determined that this problem is worthy of a section in their Udemy course, the chances are that there will be great interest in a blog post about it as well.

**Action Step:**

Type the keyword into the search bar of Udemy, you should find a ton of relevant courses that have been uploaded by industry experts.  

Take a look at the course material, including the chapters of each lesson. 

Take a look at the amount of people who purchased the course. (If the number is high, it shows that people are **willing to put skin in the game** to learn about these topics, which is the *ultimate proof of concept for a subtopic*.)

# Browse Quora questions

Quora is a social network based on questions and answers. Any member can ask a question for free and have it answered by users with specialist knowledge. 

This is another great source for problems that your blog readers would like solving. 

You’ll have loads of expert opinions to explore within the Quora answers.

**Action Step:**

Type your keyword into Quora and browse the most related category. The question with the most engagement will be a great candidate for a blog post. 

# Play with Google Autocomplete 

You may have noticed that when you begin to type a keyword into Google, it will try to autocomplete your search. 

These suggestions are based on the most commonly-searched keywords. 

As such, you can get a good impression of what people are most interested in about a certain topic by playing around with this feature. 

**Action Step:**

Type your keyword into Google. Without pressing enter, add spaces before and after the keywords to populate the most search keyword terms.

Alternatively, type your keyword into Google Keyword Planner for a full breakdown of monthly search volumes of related keywords.

# Search Wikipedia

Wikipedia can’t be fully relied upon for accurate fact, but it will usually help you come up with suggestions for sub-topics to explore around your niche. 

**Action Step:**

Have a look at the Wikipedia page for the topic you’re covering and see what subheadings are used. 

This could be the foundation for future blog posts, although you should fact-check your post using a more reliable website.

With these four options combined, you should be able to gain years worth of popular blog content surrounding a single subject, even if you’re unfamiliar with the burning issues.

5 Signs of Ineffective Content Marketing,34,d3753r,https://www.reddit.com/r/content_marketing/comments/d3753r/5_signs_of_ineffective_content_marketing/,18,1568319964.0," 

Content marketing is a crucial digital marketing tactic that aims to drive profitable customer action by consistently creating and publishing valuable content to connect with a targeted audience. It is interconnected with SEO and social media marketing. The task of constantly having to create unique and relevant content can be challenging but can yield high rewards. However, do you know the signs of ineffective content marketing?

What are the signs that indicate that you may want to take a second look at your current strategy? Here are some key factors you should qualify to help you make that call:

## Ineffective Content Marketing Indicator #1: No significant change in follower count

Your consistent effort of supplying content to your audience should gain you a valuable amount of interactions from both existing and new followers.

If you haven’t seen a change in your count, your content may not be relevant or valuable to your audience. Reassess the needs and wants of your audience to re-engage them. Although follower count is not a good measure of your worth, it still is an identifier of how effective your strategy is.

## Ineffective Content Marketing Indicator #2: Traffic is low

Your content should always aim to direct users towards your website and increase your search engine ranking. If people find your content interesting and helpful, they are more likely to visit your site or page voluntarily. Chances are, your loyal audience will keep coming back to your site because they’ve already established trust and connection with you. However, if your ranking has been stagnant and traffic is non-existent, it indicates an opportunity to explore a different angle when creating content.

## Ineffective Content Marketing Indicator #3: Your readers don’t stay longer than 2 minutes

To know if your content is interesting enough for your readers, they should be willing to stay on your page for more than 2 minutes. Look at your Google Analytics to see how long your readers are spending on your most viewed blogs. If they are only staying not longer than 2 minutes, it could be another opportunity to revamp your content and get them interested again.

## Ineffective Content Marketing Indicator #4: Lack of any prominent piece

You should have a few outstanding content pieces that stand out to your audience. These pieces are identified by having gained a good number of shares and likes.

Use these pieces of content as your starting point to create new ideas and topics that you know your audience will enjoy.

## Ineffective Content Marketing Indicator #5: Low engagement rates

The level of engagement between your audience and your content indicates how relatable and effective your content is. Engagement is present in the form of likes, shares, and comments so you need to closely monitor the response of your readers. If users like and share your posts, it’s a positive sign. However, if the level of engagement is low and there only a few responses to your posts, it’s an opportunity to explore why.  

If you ever find yourself at the receiving end of these scenarios, there’s no need to be discouraged. Any obstruction is an opportunity to improve you’re your digital marketing strategies for success.

### Here are a few tips on how you can do exactly that:

According to statistics, all successful businesses prepare a well-organized content marketing strategy. Every business must prioritize the development and documentation of its content marketing strategy, without this success of a business organization is not possible.

✅ Researching the keyword

The foundation of any good content depends on good research because you need to be sure that whatever you say is authentic. Always remember what you promote online will build your reputation, thus you need to be comprehensive, accurate with your answers, which is only possible with good research skills.

✅ Storytelling capacity

Despite having the best research skills, if the content you are writing can’t attract viewers then your entire effort will fall futile. You have to be the one who can catch their attention by writing engaging posts with proper keywords, pictures, infographics, and links.

✅ Analytics

This involves gathering data on your company’s sales, leads, subscriptions, visitors, social media engagement and of course knowing about the content that is generating good traffic.

How The $750 million Mattress Company Casper Does Content Marketing (3 Strategies),27,8q9flu,https://www.reddit.com/r/content_marketing/comments/8q9flu/how_the_750_million_mattress_company_casper_does/,4,1528751648.0,"Hey Reddit!

My friend Sam recently spent a month reverse\-engineering Caper's entire marketing strategy and today, I want to share their content marketing strategies.

If you’re not familiar, Casper sells mattresses and is valued at $750 million and serves more than 1 million customers in eight countries.

This post contains:

1. **Answer Your Target Market’s Questions (To\-Fu)**
2. **Create a Go\-To Comparison Resource (MoFu)**
3. **Showcase All Reviews in One Place (BoFu)**

Casper leverage three content archetypes as part of their strategy, each with the goal of nudging prospects further along the purchase funnel.

As a refresher, here’s an example of a funnel, including examples of content archetypes at each stage:

[https://i.imgur.com/57dNwyc.png](https://i.imgur.com/57dNwyc.png)

Let’s take a look:

## Strategy #1: Answer Your Target Market’s Questions (To-Fu)

Casper’s blog, [Pillow Talk](http://blog.casper.com/), ranks on page one for many medium\-tail keywords such as “can’t sleep” and “sleeping positions.” They also rank for more general, long\-tail search queries like “what to do when you can’t sleep” and “how to go to sleep earlier.”

[https://i.imgur.com/uPzkH4H.png](https://i.imgur.com/uPzkH4H.png)

Much of their To\-Fu content is short\-form and humorous, whereas others, as we’ll see in Part 3: Strategy #2, is well\-researched.

[https://i.imgur.com/o6vr0Lw.png](https://i.imgur.com/o6vr0Lw.png)

Interestingly, rather than ask for an email address on these pages, Casper incentivize you to submit a survey about your sleeping habits, offering a $25 discount as a reward.

[https://i.imgur.com/IpWiI23.png](https://i.imgur.com/IpWiI23.png)

In it, they ask questions about your preferred sleeping position, your evening routine, as well as general demographic questions about your age, income, gender, and more:

[https://i.imgur.com/ffVxJkA.png](https://i.imgur.com/ffVxJkA.png)

At the end of the survey, they ask for your email, before offering you a coupon code.

[https://i.imgur.com/B5tVjgV.png](https://i.imgur.com/B5tVjgV.png)

Casper even tracks how many visitors click “Shop Casper” after completing the survey to determine whether it’s a strategy worth continuing:

[https://i.imgur.com/PjrI3Di.png](https://i.imgur.com/PjrI3Di.png)

And it’s clever, for three reasons:

1. Answering their target buyer’s most pressing questions increases Casper’s organic footprint in the SERPs and positions them as a market authority.
2. Surveying visitors that have come from specific search queries gives them a highly\-targeted focus group and feedback so they can improve their marketing.
3. Offering a discount, front\-end, to a visitor who came from organic search fast\-tracks impulse buyers without the need to pay for traffic (more on that in Part 4).

**Action Item:** Using sites like Quora and Reddit, research your target market’s most pressing questions and create content that answers those questions.

## Strategy #2: Create a Go-To Comparison Resource (MoFu)

A common obstacle to buying something, like a mattress, is not knowing which is right for you.

As mentioned above, there are lots of considerations such as the type of mattress, its size, its firmness, and more.

Casper help potential buyers overcome confusion with their [mattress size comparison guide.](https://casper.com/ca/en/mattress-size-comparison-guide/)

[https://i.imgur.com/lZDF3KS.png](https://i.imgur.com/lZDF3KS.png)

While it isn’t very long, it does rank for hundreds of keywords in position #1, including several long\-tail keywords like “king size bed dimensions” and “queen mattress dimensions.”

[https://i.imgur.com/wxOBOTd.png](https://i.imgur.com/wxOBOTd.png)

And, for keywords that it doesn’t rank position #1 for, it ranks for featured snippets (also known as Position #0).

For example, for “queen size bed dimensions in feet,” they rank position #6 (at time of writing), but rank for a featured snippet, stealing [8.6&#37; of all clicks](https://ahrefs.com/blog/find-featured-snippets/) in the process.

[https://i.imgur.com/5L8pCb0.png](https://i.imgur.com/5L8pCb0.png)

What’s interesting is, rather than ask you for feedback on this page, as they do for their To\-Fu content, Casper invite you to enter a competition.

[https://i.imgur.com/D9QoI4E.png](https://i.imgur.com/D9QoI4E.png)

It’s clever. A visitor who is comparing mattress sizes is likely further along the buyer’s journey than someone who is searching for sleeping aids. So, Casper asks for an email, rather than feedback, and introduce their products in their onboarding emails (more on that in Part 5).

**Action Item:** If you sell different types of product (e.g. cosmetics like foundation), create a comparison guide that helps buyers find the right one for them. Bonus if you can rank it well in the SERPs.

## Strategy #3: Showcase All Reviews in One Place (BoFu)

You know the importance of using customer testimonials to help close potential buyers. But are you showcasing them as best as you can?

Knowing the importance of reviews in a competitive market, Casper showcases all their reviews on one page on their site.

First, they feature written reviews by their customers, including the person’s name, where they’re from, and how they rate Casper.

[https://i.imgur.com/P6ceE5U.png](https://i.imgur.com/P6ceE5U.png)

Casper is 100&#37; transparent here. If you click, “See all reviews,” you can read everything their customers say about them, including the unhappy ones.)

Beneath their customer reviews, you can read tweets from customers, adding further to the legitimacy of their reviews

[https://i.imgur.com/ZVPrMSh.png](https://i.imgur.com/ZVPrMSh.png)

Finally, Casper adds the third layering of social proof: media badges and press mentions.

[https://i.imgur.com/S6JRIfu.png](https://i.imgur.com/S6JRIfu.png)

**Action Item:** It’s common for online stores to have their reviews on third\-party sites. But that doesn’t always mean its a best practice. Take your best reviews and have them on one page on your site so you have more control over how you market your business.

Is a web app ideal for social marketing automation, a social media content generator. You can choose from a wide range of topics and enjoy an original set of custom quotes, with backgrounds chosen from a quality set of royalty-free images. 

I appreciate if someone let me know where could be a great place to show this app, because I think is useful but for a very specific niche.

What's your 2019 content plan?,23,a1sviw,https://www.reddit.com/r/content_marketing/comments/a1sviw/whats_your_2019_content_plan/,11,1543616914.0,"One of my main goals for 2019 is to produce content to distribute on a daily basis.

At the moment, I average one blog post per week, on a very good month!

I am in the middle of designing my content plan for 2019 and how I can achieve this lofty goal.

Would love to hear from other people about how they do two things.

1. Brainstorm content
2. Design their distribution schedule.

As part of this research, I did a short analysis of [Gary Vee's mammoth content plan](https://www.mrgaryfox.com/blog/2018/11/30/how-to-copy-the-gary-vee-content-plan), let me know what you think.

2. Outline of the ideas in Evernote.
3. Research about any gaps in the topic I might want to cover.

Useful B2B content marketing strategies,22,devsl0,https://www.reddit.com/r/content_marketing/comments/devsl0/useful_b2b_content_marketing_strategies/,22,1570542203.0,"I moderate a community platform for digital marketing case studies and one of our users just shared some useful tips around B2B content marketing strategies.

I’ve always worked on the B2C side myself, so it was interesting to hear how this strategy differed. Unlike B2C brands, the acquisition timeline for B2B users can be long and difficult to track.

Just wanted to share a few highlights from the post and hear if anyone else had some additional suggestions.  


**Content formats**

The top performing content for this B2B brand were: 

* Blogs and case studies
* Guides
* Guest publishing content as thought leaders across other brand blogs  


**Distribution channels**

In this particular case, the B2B brand mentioned that email and trade shows (much to my surprise) were the best channels for distributing content.

When they shared content to social channels like Facebook and LinkedIn, they found that it performed best when shared by the internal employees of the brand.

By using their personal networks, it helped promote the content to new audiences.

They also found that industry groups across Facebook and LinkedIn were useful for collaborating with niche audiences.  


**Paid vs organic**

Although paid performance channels helped drive traffic, the organic traffic sources would drive more conversion goals.

  
**Reporting**

As B2B conversions have a longer lead time, the best tools to monitor content performance were:

* SEMrush (keyword tracking)
* Google Tag Manager for event tracking
* Google Analytics custom conversion goals

Let me know if there’s anything you’d recommend that has worked for you in the past.",2019-10-08 08:43:23

I was thinking of putting tips and tricks on there and then selling services as a side. But mainly a blog/forum. A lot of the tips I know are from like years and years of learning; people would have to scour the internet. But I’d put the info by social media platform.

Just curious do you think there’s a need for this? Or are people mainly looking to hire big firms with dedicated credentials. I see a lot of marketing students here. I’m no marketing expert, but I’m a creative designer. From working close with the marketing experts and from my own personal experience I’ve gotten pretty good. Most of my accounts are past 10k followers on Instagram. One even at 30k.

The content strategy that grew our bog to 1 million monthly readers,21,8uw3yv,https://www.reddit.com/r/content_marketing/comments/8uw3yv/the_content_strategy_that_grew_our_bog_to_1/,15,1530330753.0,"Hey folks,

The company I work for is in the B2B space, and our content team has managed to grow our blog to 1 million monthly unique sessions.

I put together a guide on it here: https://blog.capterra.com/b2b-content-marketing-strategy/

We've generally not promoted our traffic levels (we're an example of what Jimmy Daley of animalz.co calls successful ""silent content"") but thought our experience might help other folks in B2B struggling in the early days with their own content programs.

I also added a free download in the piece of all our original strategy docs, plus a bunch of process docs and checklists we use currently to help others jumpstart their content teams.

Quick summary of some main points in the guide:

* Hiring full-time writers ensures higher content quality and quantity than trying to rely on existing employees to write content in between their other full-time work. Hire for writing ability, not industry knowledge.
* Commit to an actual strategy on paper, because that helps with executive buy-in plus identifying gaps in your strategic thinking (also makes you come up with an explicit ""why"" you're doing content in the first place)
* You content should target the entire realm of your reader's professional life, not just the very narrow Venn diagram where their professional life intersects with your product or service.
* For distribution, pick one main channel and one or two ancillary channels. Content is a long game and if you spread yourself too thin, you won’t be able to devote the time and energy to build up the content you need in any one channel. 
* Our internal data show that, on average, traffic to our content doesn’t really pick up steam until month five and doesn’t peak until 10 months after publication, so focus on the long term and don't try to monetize your content too soon, or it will distort how you write and make pieces too salesy.
* You should publish more content at first to see what sticks for your audience, then scale those content types. We publish 3 posts per week per writer, and update our top performing pieces every 6-12 months.
* You probably won't experience ""hockey stick"" traffic growth. Our traffic growth was all linear, and it took us 5 years, but we achieved content marketing success without having to discover “the next best thing,” or having a “viral” hit, or getting oodles of fawning tier one media exposure.

And the free downloads I link at the end of the piece are:

* Our original, two-page content strategy doc
* Our original, two-page promotion strategy
* The promotion checklist our writers use for each of their pieces
* The checklist we use to guide our quarterly topic planning
* A printable worksheet to help you think through and outline your own content strategy

Should one focus on content creation or SEO?

I'm hoping that if I were to work on the content, then by virtue of the fact that I am creating so much content related to my niche, that the content will be able to take care of any shortcomings related with SEO / keywords etc - by building a community of people who will regularly be coming back to the site, which will then end up resulting in Google having to recognise the site more.

* It makes us look like a cheap knock off version of the website we are copying from. Think about it, if they want to read the news, why wouldn't they come to the NEWS site and read from them?

* The articles are BORING as fuck and repetitive: ""Top 10 schools in England, Top 5 schools..."". It's much worse than what you see on WatchMojo channel because they at least putting in some interesting facts in their video, not just listing out some number like ""Oh, this college is the best because they have XXX students, YYY teachers, offer ZZZ jobs"". 

* Because of how easy copy-pasting is, he now wants me to make 2 posts/day. So basically, I'm bombarding audiences with 2 low quality posts every day,

* Speaking of which, my boss still thinks that social media is simply a platform to advertise products and services with cheap price. There was no community building, no events... only posts with articles and ads about our service.

* I don't have much chance to improve my writing skills or to apply social media techniques. (I already gave up on improving my skills by handling this company's fanpage and planning on creating my own page and website for that purpose.)

Is anyone in the same position? What should I do to make the most out of this situation?",2019-09-17 05:26:11
Why not video marketing? It's more engaging than text or image-based content.,21,bas8l6,https://www.reddit.com/r/content_marketing/comments/bas8l6/why_not_video_marketing_its_more_engaging_than/,30,1554748916.0,"  

Marketers are hearing a lot of stats about video marketing such as: people watch 5 billion videos on YouTube daily, 1200% more social shares come from videos etc. And that’s more than text or image-based posts. Also, videos if placed on landing pages of the websites, chances of customer conversions go around 80%. 

On top of all that, 80% of the video watchers can recall the ad they watched in the past month on a digital platform. 

Now we are clear that videos can do a lot better than other content types. So how should I create videos of my products or what should be my video marketing campaign strategy. There is nothing wrong if you are doing things from the scratch. You can make professional videos with some solid tips we are about to share in this blog post. 

**Tell a story and don’t push for sales**

There is a lot of selling videos clutter over the internet, your customer is already consuming such videos and may be irritated. Don’t be direct with the sales strategy through your video marketing campaigns. 

Try to tell a story and don’t be hard for sales. The rule is same as of content marketing for videos. Appeal to your customer’s hidden desires and needs. This won’t take away your lead, because you can always place a tracked call-to-action URL at the end of the video.

Example here is of Warby Parker’s eyeglasses. The video is telling a story along with sharing the brand ethos, culture and the customers they engage. 

**Focus on first 10 seconds of the video**

Most of your viewers click away if they don’t find the video interesting. Stats say, 1/5th of the customers leave the video if it doesn’t captivate them. Short and crisp first part of the video it must be, that’s what even video marketing experts recommend. 

Hook the audience by asking questions or builds curiosity by making short teasers. A video should quickly convey its value and communicate why it should be watched further. 

**You can use humor, don’t be boring**

Social media manager at Cisco says, “Often in the corporate world, people get nervous about comedy and say it doesn’t belong here. But if it might help you get a point across efficiently and economically, why wouldn’t you try it and see if you can make it work?”

Your audience want something out of the routine, they want enlightenment, laugh etc. It’s tricky sometimes as how humor could affect the brand in itself.

As you’ll see, most of the larger channels were hardly affected at all, as most were able to replenish their numbers loss within just a few hours. This is part of the benefit of having such a large daily growth rate.

However, many of the mid-tier channels (1 million and below)  were dramatically affected, as these channels are still in a stage where “every subscriber matters.” This is clearly evident by the results shown in the  [“Blockchain & Cryptocurrency”](https://socialbook.io/blog/blockchain-influencer-reference/) category; a new category where the top influencer only has 300k subscribers.

The Micro Influencers (Less than a million) got hit real bad. I'll be compiling a list of the ones who got hit the worst, and updating the existing links once the Purge is confirmed to be completely over.

I also intend to build a backlink strategy. The best one I can think of is to get backlinks from the experts we quote. 

I also want to neutralize external criticism of our brand published on one very credible site, hence the urgency in having the Google algorithm favour our page over theirs.

Content Recycling 101,19,dipn62,https://www.reddit.com/r/content_marketing/comments/dipn62/content_recycling_101/,23,1571262891.0,"Content recycling goes beyond reposting previously published pieces of content like blogs, videos and images. On a broader sense, content recycling means re-purposing any existing content in the same or different format. 

**Ways to Recycle Content:**

* Use previous blogs and turn them into infographics
* Take information clips from old blogs and make a video out of it
* Turn your content images to GIFs
* Create #throwbackthursday posts
* Cross-post your content to other social media channel

**Why Should You Recycle Content?**

* Content recycling fills the gap whenever you're too busy to create new posts for your pages.
* Your old posts may be relevant with the current buzz.
* It allows you to cater to different time zones by posting the same content across various time slots.
* Content recycling provides a healthy supply of content to be repurposed.

**Tips and Tricks**

* Select from our old posts which are worth repurposing.
* Check the past performances of your old content to see which has the potential to help in your engagement and traffic.
* Look for your evergreen content such as how-tos and tips as they stay relevant over a long time.
* Creativity is a must when recycling content. Transform your old content into new forms and format and update them with new theories and statistics or you can combine several pieces into one piece. 

When lacking in time to create fresh content, content recycling is your go-to strategy. It's a cost-effective marketing effort that brings out creativity and productivity and has the power to boost your traffic and engagement.",2019-10-16 16:54:51

Is content marketing really applicable to every industry?,18,cd41yn,https://www.reddit.com/r/content_marketing/comments/cd41yn/is_content_marketing_really_applicable_to_every/,31,1563145816.0,"I'm starting to wonder whether content marketing really *always should (or at least, can)* be applied to *truly any business.*

&#x200B;

Why?

&#x200B;

Content marketing boils down to giving the potential customer a **SHITLOAD** of value. You nurture them like your baby, teach them, give them information. Help them solve pain points, and all that.

&#x200B;

Then, at one point, you come up to them and ask: ""Oh, hey there *student,* now I am offering you this paid service.""

&#x200B;

Assuming your content is so awesome that the prospect really does perceive you as an expert in the field, let's make a comparison: what would you feel like if your high school maths teacher came up to you after so many years of quality tutoring (assuming free of charge) and now wanted to turn a buck on you?

&#x200B;

Well, I can tell you, I'd feel betrayed, pissed... one word, played.

&#x200B;

Now, I realise CM can obviously be applied to businesses which offer *educational services,* since content itself really is a ""teaser"" into what their paid educational plans or materials have to offer.

&#x200B;

But how would CM be applied to other industries? Say, how would content marketing benefit a **local coffee shop or a laundry business?**",2019-07-14 18:10:16

2. Content marketing gets three times more leads than paid search advertising.
3. 96% of B2B buyers want content with more input from industry thought leaders.

The tips are the following.

1. Everyone's consuming on **YouTube** and **Spotify** which is where creators need to be in the unending pursuit of eyeballs.
2. Be ready and have a plan B. Content creators need to be using the platforms where people are, therefore. “But at the same time, in case something happens, try to get the email, have your own website, have a robust communication channel with the audience from which you can’t get banned. Don’t get too comfortable.” 
3. Network and get in touch with other influencers and other content creators. Get support from the creators community and get in touch, in case of an event. In the case of the bitcoin and cryptocurrency purge from youtube in 2019, Ivan on Tech talks about how they got together and made noise about it until YouTube finally admitted it was a mistake.

Avoid using jargon, fancy vocabulary or showing a professorial attitude unless the audience calls for it. Reminder, not everyone who needs your insights or information is a scholar, try to write articles that are easily understood by people at and above the middle school grade level or by immigrants who have limited vocabulary in your language.

Written content is undoubtedly useful but today visual materials such as infographics or videos are outperforming for marketing purposes and they will continue to be one of the most frequently used content marketing strategies for 2020.

Since it is far simpler for people to remember visual information than the same information in written form because the human brain processes visuals 60,000 times faster than text. That’s why marketing videos and especially infographics are all the rage now:

· Infographics can increase web traffic by around 12%. (Demand Gen Report)

· Posts with images usually have 650% higher engagement than text-only posts. (Webdam)

· 30% of marketers use graphics, such as infographics, more often than any other type of visual content. (Venngage)

· Content with relevant images gets 94% more views than the same content without image. (Quick Sprout)",2019-12-23 14:25:44

The first step to getting your market’s attention, is talking about what they care about — right?

Well, it sounds simple enough…

Until you’re responsible for coordinating 6 Tweets, 4 IG posts, and 1 Facebook post per day PLUS 1 (or more) weekly email blasts for months on end.

Yikes! Needing to pump out that ridiculous amount of content day in and day out can drain even the most chatty and creative person, that’s for sure.

Ecommerce owners, how do you drive traffic to your site? I bet that paid ads are a big part of your traffic strategy (especially Facebook ads) — right? (Right????)

Creating sales and promotions have always been a key tool in driving revenue for retail businesses.

They key to a successful promotion, a Christmas or Valentine’s day promotion for example, is having the foresight to plan it in advance.

Really, you should be planning your promotions out — locking down a date, creating promotional materials, getting clear on your paid advertising strategy, setting up the “backend” (like creating the coupon code, how big of a discount, writing promotional emails to go along with it) — a few weeks to a month in advance.
You can even easily plan a few months, or a year in advance with what I’m about to show you.

I’m going to show you what tools I use to get unlimited ideas for timely posts. Facebook ads, content marketing/blog posts, email blasts, interacting on Twitter, Instagram, and unlimited ideas for any time you’re talking about your business.",2017-04-04 15:52:22

So, I recently started doing freelance work as a ""content creator."" In the past I have done a few podcasts, have written about niche subjects, and have also done short videos, all of these things for recreational purposes but with a work-vibe to them in case I ever wanted to make money out of it. Which I intend to do now.

I am deeply inspired by Matt D'Avella and other creators that create value but also entertain. I'm also inspired by podcasts like Taking Note by Evernote, Relate by Zendesk and Overtime by Dribble and now I want to create something like that but for ""uncelebrated businesses."" Let me explain what I mean by that.

In my city, there are many trendy and hip places to go for nearly everything. But there's also a huge amount of businesses that are likely on the verge of bankruptcy. Diners, old coffee shops, alterations and repairs, stuff like that.

I believe that all of these people deserve good design and good content just as much as the hipstery bars and startups. I can easily make logos and merch for them, create or update their website, but when it comes to content marketing, here is my idea.

So my idea is to make (or to offer making) short documentaries (15 mins max), and/or podcasts (running about 4 episodes or so). The topics covered can range from the person's journey in life (since many of these folks are immigrants, I'm sure there's some really good stories to uncover there) \[Btw, I'm an immigrant myself\]. We could also talk some of the lessons learned while in business. That's something tech startups do all the time, learn from founders. And just outright document the uniqueness of their business and clientele. Just as an example, not far from where I live there is a Greek-Chinese-Canadian restaurant....

How would I monetize this? I'm just starting out so I would keep my prices incredibly affordable - or work in exchange of goods/services. OR brand myself as some cool content-creator-travel-guide kind of person and document my city. Get money from views on YouTube etc.

How do you hire/manage freelancers for content creation and content marketing?,15,6iemca,https://www.reddit.com/r/content_marketing/comments/6iemca/how_do_you_hiremanage_freelancers_for_content/,10,1498000182.0,"The startup I work at has recently started bulking up its content marketing efforts. But since we can't produce all our content in-house, we've been working with a few freelancers. 

What we've found, however, is that the collaboration experience and quality of work vary from freelancer to freelancer--and sometimes even from article to article from the same freelancer.

We've been trying to streamline our process, and I came upon this article by Airtable today that I found quite interesting. It's called ""How to run a content pipeline with a large team of remote freelancers."" (https://airtable.news/how-to-run-a-content-pipeline-with-a-large-team-of-remote-freelancers-71e19e9e03c4)

I thought the article hit the nail on the head when it said: 
""The crux of the challenge with running a team of freelance writers is that they have other clients: you are not always their priority, but they are always your priority. This makes coordinating schedules and planning ahead significantly more challenging than if your writers were full-time employees. 
 
""The only way to maintain sanity is to develop really good processes so that you always know who is working on what and when it’s due.""

The piece then goes on to explain how to set up a multi-dimensional process fo the content in production (rather a linear one of ""assign topic - write article"" which hardly ever works). 

I thought this approach was very interesting and that it would benefit others here who're working with freelancers to produce their content marketing plan. 

I also wanted to ask: 
What process do you use for content production (particularly with freelancers)?
How do you make sure everything (drafts, revisions, etc) get delivered at the right time (without freelancers flaking or putting into their lower priorities?

"I recently interviewed a bunch of LinkedIn influencers on how they consistently go viral on LinkedIn, generating them millions of views and hundreds of leads automatically. Here's what I learnt, and the 10 best tips you can apply right away to your LinkedIn marketing.",16,70zfm0,https://www.reddit.com/r/content_marketing/comments/70zfm0/i_recently_interviewed_a_bunch_of_linkedin/,5,1505811154.0,"The story started simple.

It started with a request from my boss:

“Yo, let’s try to figure out if we could get traffic from LinkedIn back to the blog.”

This one question led me down the rabbit hole of LinkedIn marketing — and in turn figuring out how to go viral, get traffic and build a brand.

But I’ll be honest. I didn’t do this alone.

My knowledge about LinkedIn and its mysterious algorithm — and how to do well on it — came from reading countless of case studies and interviewing the experts who have figured out the platform.

The result?

This list of tips you can use to succeed.

Keep on reading.

**#1: Stop Focusing On Going Viral**

Wait… What?

Is this some kind of clickbait article where you write a misleading headline and then tell me something completely opposite?

That may be half-true.

You see:

Going insanely viral is mostly a matter of luck. Nobody can ever explain why the “Cash Me Outside” girl become so famous overnight.

The next best thing you can do is to prepare for the day that you go viral.
But, you must first understand:

**If you put all your focus on trying to become viral, what is likely to happen is that you will become encumbered, bitter and disappointed.**

You’ll stop doing the right thing, and focus on all sorts of “weird tricks” and “hacks” to achieve virality, which defeats your purpose for being on LinkedIn in the first place.

**Remember: virality is merely a mean to an end — not the end itself.**

[Manu Goswami](https://www.linkedin.com/in/swishgoswami/) says:

>One of the biggest mistakes I’m starting to see on the platform is content creators who are so focused on views and likes. LinkedIn is about growing your brand and business but that isn’t just done by posting viral content. It’s actually done a lot better by genuinely helping people by connecting them to each other, finding them positions, or including them in stimulating discussions.

Instead of focusing on going viral, focus on helping people. Focus on becoming a *resourceful person.*

What happens is that people will begin to take notice of you, and even look up to you and treat you like a thought leader.

When that day comes, your posts will go viral by itself, because people will reciprocate due to you demonstrating your genuineness and authenticity over and over again.

**#2: Build Your Personal Story**

Most of us never figure out who we are.

We become parrots — copying and regurgitating thoughts, opinions and viewpoints that are not ours, but heard from elsewhere.

But, to succeed on social media, you MUST know who you are, or at least what you represent and who you want to be.

Why?

Because they are fed up with the insincere people showing off their fake “good life” without ever expressing the human side of themselves.

They want authenticity. They want sincerity. They want to see what it’s like to struggle and overcome.

Top LinkedIn influencer [Michaela Alexis](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelaalexis/) puts it succinctly:

>I think the biggest mistake I see is people presenting themselves as somebody that they think they SHOULD be, rather than the awesome human being that they actually are. There’s been an idea in business for a very long time that we need to “leave our personal issues at home”, like we can all just somehow shut off the human part of our brain as soon as we step into the office. That may have been semi manageable, prior to platforms like LinkedIn that are redefining the business culture.
>I have yet to meet or chat with a single person that doesn’t have an inspiring story to tell, and yet, so many users are avoiding telling that story and opting instead to mask themselves in itchy suits and spammy pitches.

You don’t have to be fake. You don’t have to pretend to be someone else. You can be honest, vulnerable and connect with other people.

But first:

You need to know who you are.

Michaela continues:

>… I would run you through our personal branding workshop, which goes through your strengths, weaknesses, values, and goals. We’ll talk about your failures and what that failure taught you to help you ultimately succeed.

**Here are some questions you can ask yourself to establish your own personal brand:**

* What are my values?
* Why do I do what I do? Who or what am I doing it for?
* What do I want to be known for?
* What do I want the world to know about me that’s unique?
* What topics can you talk endlessly about?
* What do people say about you? What do people praise you for?
* How do you do what you do? What makes the way you achieve results interesting or unique?
* What energizes or ignites you? What are your true passions?

Summing it up with a last quote from Michaela:

>You’d be surprised at how quickly people succeed online when they just have a clear idea of who they are and why they do what they do.

**#3: Optimize Your LinkedIn Profile**

Your LinkedIn profile is akin to your company homepage.

You can have the best content in the world, but if your homepage does not communicate its value proposition, you will lose your customer’s interest.

As [Josh Fechter](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joshuafechter/), founder of Badass Marketers and Founders (https://www.facebook.com/groups/growthmarketers/) puts it:

>When people look at your profile, they decide whether you’re worth connecting with in several seconds.

It starts with your headshot.

Despite its recent algorithm changes to become more Facebook-like, LinkedIn is still at heart, a platform for professionals.

Which means:

**Your pictures must look professional.**

Contrary to popular belief, you do not need to be in a suit and tie to convey “professionalism.” As long as the photo is professionally taken and you look good, it’ll work.

Here's an example: [IMAGE](https://www.referralcandy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/brett-berhoff-600x455.png)

Then, you have to optimize your cover photo.

According to Josh, there are three kind of photos that will increase your add-back percentage:

>1. You with a relevant influencer in your industry
>2. You speaking in front of prospects
>3. You at a local landmark (only works if you’re connecting with people in your city)

An example of a photo with a relevant influencer: [IMAGE](https://www.referralcandy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/josh-fechter-600x474.png)

Speaking in front of prospects: [IMAGE](https://www.referralcandy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/shinjini-das-600x454.png)

Local landmark: [IMAGE](https://www.referralcandy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/hailey-friedman-600x408.png)

Once again, these help communicate professionalism, expertise and social proof.

**Pro-Tip:** To find out if your profile is “optimized” enough, measure your add-back percentage. Your add-back percentage is the percentage of connection requests you send out that get accepted.

After you’re done with the 2 photos, it’s time to work on your headline.

Polishing up your LinkedIn profile is like writing a good sales letter — lead with a attention-grabbing image, then hook their attention into interest with a fantastic headline.

Top content marketer [Aaron Orendorff](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aaronorendorff/) says:
>“Think of your headline as a tiny sales pitch. You have to answer “here’s why you should trust me” or “here’s why I’d be a valuable addition to your network” and “here’s what I do and who I do it for best”

Here's a good headline example: [IMAGE](https://www.referralcandy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/aaron-zakowski-600x473.png)

When that is done, it’s time to write your bio.

Josh argues that the biggest mistake made by people on LinkedIn is the **lack of specificity**.

Meaning:

When glancing at the summary, you should be able to tell what the person does and how the person can help you.

Your summary should look something like this: [IMAGE](https://www.referralcandy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/josh-fechter-bio-600x487.png)

Fix that by writing a great value proposition. According to [ConversionXL](https://conversionxl.com/blog/value-proposition-examples-how-to-create/), this is what makes a good value proposition:

* Clear language
* Communicates concrete results your prospect or customer will get
* Says how it’s different or better than everyone else
* Avoid hype and jargon
* Read and understood in 5 seconds

You can also add your other social profiles to your summary to connect with others elsewhere.

**#4: Build Your Connections**

After you’ve optimized your profile, it’s time to build up your connection base.

However… Before we begin, I have something to say:

There are conflicting theories on how important your connections are to generating views and going viral.

[Hailey Friedman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hailey-friedman-44897734/) told me that:

>**It’s important to note that you do not need millions of followers on Linkedin to have your post seen by millions of people.** In fact, the number of followers or connections you have has nothing to do with how many people see your Linkedin post. The Linkedin Gods are far more mysterious and fickle.

However, on the other hand, [Vin Clancy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vincentdignan/), another LinkedIn influencer says:

>… People not attempting to grow aggressively enough- if you only have 300 connections, content is pretty much a waste of time.

>You need a fast follower/connection growth strategy.

While we may never have the actual answer, I believe it lies somewhere in between both, which is:

**The number of connections does not influence whether you will go viral, but the number of connections help improve the chances of you going viral.**

Why?

Because of one simple fact — all of your LinkedIn connections become your followers.
That means every time you post content, the people who are likely to see it are your connections.

Having a larger connection base help increases the chances of people seeing and engaging with your post, which increases the chance of it going viral.

However, don’t blindly accept everyone on LinkedIn either.

As with building any social following, the most important thing you should wish for is *quality, not quantity*.

You may have a network of 10,000 connections, but if they are all unrelated to your brand or who you want to reach, you will not get any engagement.

Connect ONLY with people who are your ideal customers and will buy your product or services, or at least engage with the type of content you wish to create.

So, how do you build up your connection base?

**A — Connect all your emails to your LinkedIn Account**

This tip is from Justin Wu, who says:

>The first step would be to connect all your emails to your LinkedIn Account. LinkedIn allows you to import all your emails to seed your initial contacts. This will increase your audience size to help build your initial audience on content. So dig up all your emails that you have ever used in the past!

Import every single email you have and connect with people. LinkedIn will automatically send out a connection request to them for you.

**B — Build connections through LinkedIn Groups**

If you’re not on LinkedIn Premium, you will not be able to connect with anyone who is a 3rd connection.

**Unless you’re in the same group as them.**

One of the best parts of being in a LinkedIn Group is the ability to connect with anyone in the group.

Join LinkedIn groups relevant to your niche or your ideal customers, and then connect with them.

**C — Build connections through Facebook Groups**

[Facebook Groups](https://www.referralcandy.com/blog/facebook-groups/) are another channel that you can tap on for relevant connections.

All you have to do is to search for the relevant groups you should join, participate in the group and then create a thread asking to connect with everyone on LinkedIn. If you’re lucky, a thread may already exist and you can simply connect with everyone who has placed their LinkedIn profile inside.

**D — Connect with everyone who has liked or commented on your content**

This is what [Gilles De Clerck](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gillesdc/), another LinkedIn influencer suggests:

>LinkedIn posting has been a big deal these last few months. People started being real, sharing personal experiences, showing vulnerability and attaching powerful lessons to it. Some have been incredibly successful building up a personal brand this way. Others are still working out how to hit the sweet spot but growing with every post nonetheless. But what do all the views, likes and comments mean? It means you have a potential audience. Potential. Because one like doesn’t equal a follower. That’s why it’s interesting to be able to re-engage with these people at scale. 

All of the likes and comments you’ve accumulated are wasted if you do not connect with them. They might see your content once, then forget you entirely. However, if you connect with them, they will remember you and see your content in the future.

The thing is:

Without technology, this entire process can be a b*tch. (Multiple tabs addict, anyone?)

If you want a quick and dirty (plus techy way) of doing this properly, read these 2 guides:

* How to extract LinkedIn Likers (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ngwW-NGdvXnZY2Mu9UghfcmIMInyVSt0E0vubJiT82s/edit)
* How to extract LinkedIn Commenters (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wbJwG-WWUOkdBkWO2IP8cxw_UER9YibezSl1lc7EaII/edit)

**E — connect with everyone using tech**

Love tech and automation?

You’re not alone.

There IS a way of building your connections using automation.

Before you proceed, you need to have 2 tools in your tool kit:

* [Linked Helper](https://linkedhelper.com/) (automation tool)
* [LinkedIn Sales Navigator](https://business.linkedin.com/sales-solutions/sales-navigator#) (without this, you’ll get banned)

Then follow this automation process from Josh Fechter:

* Use LinkedIn Helper and write an invitation message
* Make it non-salesy and focus on something in common.
* Plug in a relevant search query into Sales Navigator, and then connect all 2nd contact in search.

**Pro-Tip:** According to Josh, don’t connect with more than 150 people in a 24 hour period. You’ll get banned.

**#5: Be Consistent**

In social media, there is ONE king — consistency.

GaryVee puts it quite simply:

>“Okay, I started Gary. Now what?” you ask? Keep doing it for another five years and then come back to me before you ask again.

Virality is hard to predict, and it is false to assume that you have one at bat.

Create as much content as possible, so that you increase the possibility of one of them going viral.

In fact, this is the single most common tip amongst all of the influencers I interviewed for this article.

[Thomas Ma](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tmasapphire/), founder of SapphireApps says:

>I would say you need to post every single day. Keep your story simple and make sure to document as much as you can people. People enjoy seeing the struggle and the rise of the entrepreneur.

Justin Wu expresses the same sentiment:

>Next will be post consistency. Creating at least one content post a day. Two preferred for max content spread one in morning and another at afternoon. The post would have to be pure text, and maximum character limit (1300). LinkedIn favors long posts heavily.

Gilles De Clerck says the same:

>Consistency.
>Regularly showing your face in their feeds gives people the opportunity to get to know you. They’ll remember you and will start looking out for your posts. This is how you build trust and influence.
>As you post more often, you’ll create opportunities for yourself to get better and find your sweet spot. Consistency beats perfection any day of the week.
Moral of the story?

I’ll quote Ben Bradbury here for you:
>The one thing I see all the best practicing is consistency. The more you’re on the platform, the more LinkedIn pushes you in it’s algorithm. If you want to build an audience, **you simply need to show up every day. No excuses.**

**#6: Share Your Journey**

The above quote by Thomas Ma says it all:

>People enjoy seeing the struggle and the rise of the entrepreneur.

People love to show the glamorous side of themselves on social media, even though life is not like that.

We all struggle through similar insecurities, fears and frustrations.

And it IS suffering through these obstacles that bond us together as a community.
We love movies because the idea of watching the hero struggle through challenges and eventually making it out on the other side excites us.

Guess what?

**You can be the hero too!**

Document your own journey, and bring others along with you.

Together with your audience, bring them through the rollercoaster of emotions as you struggle, fight and eventually win the day.

If you’re having trouble documenting your own journey, then follow Manu Goswami’s recommendations:

>… you’d first need to share content about your journey. That content can be informative (articles with your original commentary in the caption), inspirational (stories of your peers or quotes you like), or a personal anecdote (related to not only your victories but your struggles and failures). You need to express your thoughts honestly and authentically in order to get people to relate to it.

**#7: Know The Type of Formats That Work On LinkedIn**

When I first started using LinkedIn, it appeared that most people were simply sharing links to articles. They were either links to the articles they’ve written themselves, or links to articles they read and liked.

Turns out that it was a big mistake.

[Harsh Jani](https://www.linkedin.com/in/janiharsh/) describes:

>One of the biggest mistakes I see on LinkedIn is something I myself made for many years. Posting external links as your update. Most important thing for any platform is to keep users on the platform for as long as possible. So, when you post external links, LinkedIn will punish you by not rolling the content out to as many people as possible, as they want people to spend as much time on the platform as possible!

There is a right way of posting that generates better reach and more views for your content.

What is it?

Justin Wu has actually ran some tests for himself, and this was what he discovered:

>Don’t use links in your post at all. Don’t link to youtube either. LinkedIn favors content that is native.
>LinkedIn Posts algorithm feed favors this in order (from best reach to least):
>Texts
Images
LinkedIn Videos (Native)
>LinkedIn Articles
Links
Videos (Youtube)
>This what I found through posting for the past few months with the new changes.
>I think native video ranks in middle from reports from friends. This is all assuming your post is just using one of the following above. If you combine links + images it could just penalize it further.

But, don’t take any of our advice simply at face value. You can test it for yourself and see if those recommended formats work better for you.

**#8: Put Your Links In The First Comment**

What happens if you’ve wrote an article for a blog, or another publication? Should you share the link on LinkedIn?

Yes, you should. And you can.

Remember, not everything you do should be done for views and views only.

However, if you want more views for LinkedIn, and still drive traffic to your content, there is a way you can do so, that is:

Place your links in the first comment.

Here’s what Hailey Friedman has to say:

>This is the secret weapon that I first learned about when Guy Kawasaki posted about it on Linkedin in June 2017. He actually ran an A/B test with two posts that had the exact same copy- but one had the link in the post and the other one had the link in the first comment. The results were astounding.

>The post with the link in the comments section got 3x as many views.

I tried the same thing, and got more views and clicks to my article.

**#9: How To Format a Viral LinkedIn Post**

Before I carry on, I would love for you to understand:

Just because you’re utilizing all the “best practices” for writing and formatting a LinkedIn post doesn’t mean you’re guaranteed to go viral.

It doesn’t work that way.

Good writing IS good writing.

Formatting merely enhances it.

That being said, here are the elements to making a viral LinkedIn post, as identified by the influencers:

**A — Use spacing to make it mobile-friendly**

Most people these days are getting their social media updates via their phone.
That means: the content you write should be mobile-optimized as much as possible.

One way to do this is write each sentence spaced out rather than huge chunks of paragraphs. If you have been on LinkedIn recently, you’d probably seen many people do this.

Here’s what Hailey Friedman says:

>These days we’re constantly reading on the go. That means we’re often reading on screens no wider than 3 inches across. By spacing out your sentences, you’re ensuring that any given sentence is 2–3 “lines” long.

>This breaks the post up into bite-size chunks which are easily consumed on mobile.

**B — Create a wave pattern when writing**

In her Viral LinkedIn Checklist post, serial entrepreneur [Gretta van Riel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/grettavanriel/) identified that writing in a wave pattern increases the consumption of her content.

Hailey Friedman mentions the exact same thing in her How To Go Viral On LinkedIn blog post.

The concept is:

Start with a short sentence, and then make each subsequent sentence longer and longer and then gradually shorter and shorter, like a wave.

**C — Write an engaging hook**

Social media is all about grabbing the attention of your audience.

If you do not capture it in the first 5 seconds, you would have lost the person forever.

That’s why the most important thing you need to do is to write an engaging hook.
And in LinkedIn, your hook is the first 2 sentences.

When your reader scrolls past his LinkedIn timeline, he will only see the first 2 sentences before he has to click “see more.”

These 2 sentences are your grabber, your attention-capturing mechanism, your headline.

Spend 80% of your time on these first 2 sentences to hook your audience’s attention to read your copy.

**D — Tell a story**

As identified by researchers Chip and Dan Heath, stories are one of the main ingredients in causing sticky messages.

Apply the same concept to LinkedIn.

After capturing the attention of your audience, you must now tell an engaging story that will, in the words of the great copywriter Joseph Sugarman, “bring them down 
the grease slide.”

They should be hungrily devouring your copy… without even realizing they finished it.

But…

How do you tell a great story?

You can:
1. Follow my friend [Ben Sim](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ben-sim/)’s advice of using “in media res” or start in the middle. Instead of following the conventional advice of telling your story chronologically, start your story in the middle (usually the emotional point.) This guarantees your story to be gripping and emotional.
2. Use any of the [proven storytelling formulas](https://www.referralcandy.com/blog/storytelling-formulas) we have unearthed for you. These storytelling formulas have been used for years by Hollywood screenwriters, copywriters and fiction authors to tell stories that sell.

**E — Add a CTA**

LinkedIn favours posts that have engagement (denominated by likes and comments.)

How do you get that engagement?

ASK.

Close off your posts with a CTA. Directly ask your audience to do what you want them to do (like the post, comment) or get them to answer a question you have for 
them.

**#10: Join an engagement pod**

Do you want to know the secret behind why certain LinkedIn influencers are getting an insane number of likes and comments behind their posts?

They are part of the same group called “engagement pods.”

An engagement pod is a private chat or a group that agrees to engage with each other’s content when it is published.

Here’s what Justin Wu says about it:

>Form a private chat group with other top LinkedIn writers and create an engagement pod. Everytime someone posts, the whole group will participate on the post that will help it shoot up in the feed/algorithm. Almost all social networks newsfeed is based on engagement & activity. Getting a lot of ‘organic’ activity will allow your post to get a nice kickstart.

While engagement pods cannot guarantee virality (it is still dependent on your content), it provides a nice organic boost to your content, allowing it to be seen by others.

Now, where can you find engagement pods?

You can:

**1.Create your own**

Connect with fellow LinkedIn influencers, and agree to form a pod together.

**2. Find existing engagement pods**

There is no easy way to find existing engagement pods, but one way you can do this is to message a top influencer (who repeatedly get lots of likes) and ask if they are part of an engagement pod.

**3. Use **[Hey Engage](https://heyinfluencers.com/)**

This is Gretta van Riel’s new baby. This platform allows you to discover and join engagement pods for multiple social media platforms.

The thing is, now I want to take it all a step further. These couple of years, I have been working with an intermediary. Now I want to shape something up of my own. 

Now, I hear blogging is one of the best ways to showcase original content. In fact, I have been quite active on that subreddit, just so I can improve my knowledge about the subject. 

Are there any other ways that I can use to breakthrough in the field of content that you might be aware about?

Edit: I realized my post might not be clear. Here's a little more clarification that I mentioned in a comment:

See, what I want to say is, I have been writing for content for a while now. So I know, how it all works. I can start my own blog now and showcase my own content to create something of my own instead of working under an intermediary. And create a passive source of income from there.

First time posting here. My apologies if this is the wrong tag.

I have been working as a freelance content writer with this company for 3 months. It’s just a side gig as I was interested to learn more about this industry. She pays me about $15-$20 per article which range from 300-500 words. I don’t know how much she actually gets for these articles but I read somewhere that they usually get 3x what they’re paying so she must be getting $45-60. Not sure.

Anyways, I applied for a freelance content writing position with a company and they have asked me to tell them my rates. They will require about 3,000 words of content per week. I have absolutely 0 clue what to tell them. I have 1-2 years of experience in the marketing industry and graduated from a top school in Canada.  I read online that freelance writers earn anywhere from $0.10-$1 a word. 

My initial thought was to tell them $0.55 a word but honestly I just want to make sure. I don’t want to say anything too high either so that they don’t hire me.

Traditional TV adverts aside there are multiple ways video could be incorporated in your Sales outreach.  
In this video, Sampath Mallidi goes through 5 tips he suggests companies should start incorporating videos in their outreach.

The video goes into multiple topics and we highly recommend you check it out. In this article, however, we will go through the thesis of why you should be using the video medium to improve your brand image, improve sales outreach, and stay up to date with the trends of today.

## What type of Video Should I make

Not everyone will go through a 30 page written guide to use their newly subscribed SaaS product. There are a lot of places you could incorporate a video.

1. User Guide. Explain how your product is helpful to take the user towards their goals
2. User Onboarding. Welcome the user, and show them all the features
3. Frequently Asked Question. Most common questions, doubts, and misconceptions about your product
4. New Feature. Introducing new upgrades to your product could be tricky. It can make or break your business. Create a video Introducing the feature to different sectors of your crowd.

These are a few examples where a video would make more sense than the written word. However, this does not mean you should be abandoning the written word.

>*The key to better user experience is to provide multiple channels of knowledge and allowing the user to chose whichever they feel comfortable in.*

**Alternatively, you could also use video to entertain your audience. Like for example, the videos posted by our founder on LinkedIn is a weekly strategy.**

**The videos grab the attention of curious customers who end up either trying our** **Account-Based Marketing Product** **or purchasing** **high-end services** **offered by** **Intandemly** 

## How Many videos Should we make

The More, The Better.

By providing high quality *and* high quantity of videos, you are leaving a strong impression on your customers. This leads to your potential client taking less time to decide to pick you over your competitors.

By watching your video library, they have already familiarized themselves with your face and brand.

>*A person and a company would trust someone who has more knowledge than themselves.*

&#x200B;

## Conclusion

There’s a reason more than 500,000,000 users watch Facebook videos daily. Because It is more interactive and required less of the consumer to consume content.

By incorporating videos in your sales outreach, you are engaging the user, ensuring your reliability to the client and nurturing the leads to convert.

We would definitely love to see how you have included videos in your sales outreach process. Love to read what you have to say, leave a comment.",2019-12-02 08:15:32

Last 2 months I took over part or writing articles and that worked perfectly. We have biggest growth ever. We closed 10+ deals from my content efforts. 

Problems I have:

* don't have time, I should be faster
* I am not 100% satisfied  with the quality of the content (7/10)
* I don't have system/templates for different types of articles

What I have:

* The understanding goal of a content piece
* Understanding of IBP  (i am ideal customer persona)
* SEO writing skills
* A person who fix/edit posts so they look US/English native (we are from Europe)

&#x200B;

I am usually following guides from backlinko.. but I want to be better at this, faster and deliver the even better post.

Can u point me to some cool guides, resources, videos... advices.

Join our new subreddit r/VisualSchool. It will help you learn visually exactly what matters,11,dcaos9,https://www.reddit.com/r/content_marketing/comments/dcaos9/join_our_new_subreddit_rvisualschool_it_will_help/,2,1570054065.0,"**Dear fellow designers, programmers, students and teachers,**

We are happy to invite you to our brand new reddit community:  [**r/VisualSchool**](https://www.reddit.com/r/VisualSchool/) . Here you can learn coding, design, marketing, dev ops, security and many other skills. We want to radically improve the online learning experience by providing a visual map of knowledge trough our innovative learning platforms.

How can we improve our learning platform and help you to learn faster?

Leave us feedback on r/VisualSchool

# Why Visual School?

· **Because learning is slow** – Our current experience learning online is very rough. We are forced to spend lots of time searching for the right material. We are forced to drain lots of energy just to understand the basics.

· **Because we lose focus** – We start learning one thing and then the next few hours we are all over the web trying to put the puzzle together. It’s like going downstairs to dump the trash and returning several hours later after you were attacked by a grizzly bear in Las Vegas.

· **Because we are missing know-how** – On a daily basis we start reading some tutorial and then we find lots of strange unfamiliar concepts. All these gaps in knowledge prevent us from learning fast. Worse they divert our attention away from the main topic.

# How will we learn on Visual School?

· **Elastic lessons** – All the tutorials in Visual School are optimized to be “stretchy”. Depending on how skilled you are you can adjust each part of the lesson to give you more or less content. Users ranging from complete beginners up to experts can consume the same set of tutorials adjusted to their own needs.

· **Speed reading** – All our tutorials will be optimized for speed reading. Our approach is to integrate carefully selected and designed graphics and animations. It will look and feel like a hybrid between text, slideshows and video all optimized for learning fast. The accent is on quality not quantity.

· **Learning map** – Think of it as a subway map. Our aim is to map all the important destinations and focus your attention on what makes the biggest impact in your daily life as a professional. This map will give you awareness of the big picture.

· **Learning goals** – You will be able to setup goals and our platform will help you plan ahead a faster route towards your professional goals. We encourage exploration in all ways and forms, all while maintaining a clear deadline and end-goal.

· **Nano Lessons** – For every new unfamiliar concept you discover in the lesson you will have a mini lesson about it one click away. It will help you focus and stay on track without feeling lost.

# What will Visual School be?

· Visual School is the platform where you can study matching your own level of experience

· Visual School maintains your focus while studying a certain subject.

· Visual School fills in the gaps of knowledge right on the spot.

# Who is the audience for Visual School?

· In this current group we invited only profiles that are either strong developers or strong designers. This selection is a good representation of the audience we are targeting. We intend to reach the global market of developers in the early phase. Our first iteration of content will be about programming.

The ultimate goal of Visual School is to reduce the time spent learning and to increase the time spent coding meaningful projects. Current generation of tutorials does a decent job. The next generation of tutorials will kick ass! We want to lead the way towards this future.

When I brought to their attention that this references full frontal nudity ie. the movie industry, I was rebuked with No it's a very common phrase in Britain. Uhm we are in Indiana.

We paid thousands of dollars for a content writer to come up with this and then defend it with a ""this is common in Great Britain"" while standing in Indiana.  Any feedback? Should I push for change here? I feel like this would be a typical ""the emporer has no clothes"" scenerio because they all LOVE the whole thing and any alternate opinion is rebuked.

I am a graphic designer but have been given the role of social media manager. Which, when I worked for a company with actual products, I was able to make work. 

The thing is, it is frowned upon to discuss the contracts we have, so even if one of our clients (think resiliency, military family support, and veterans programs) does something newsworthy, there are hoops to jump through for approval and many times I’m shut down. 

I don’t know what I’m doing, first of all. I’m watching Skillshare videos about CM but it’s all about creating buyer personas and the thing is ... we only maintain a social media presence for employees. No one else really follows us. We don’t really have a product. And of course, nothing can be posted that would be viewed politically in either direction. Two of our 4 channels get spam posted by a recruiter bot 10-15 times a day. 

Yet I’m still asked to come up with a monthly calendar. I fill it with military holidays and occasional mental health or military health articles but I have no direction, no idea of how to develop a campaign. 

How in the world can I make this work? I’d love to move to a true social media or communications position in the future with graphic design support but this is so frustrating and seems utterly pointless.

How To Find The Right Niche For Your Writing,11,8mpwrj,https://www.reddit.com/r/content_marketing/comments/8mpwrj/how_to_find_the_right_niche_for_your_writing/,2,1527541518.0,"Content creation is one of the most important activities of almost all digitized businesses who are looking to gain traction and widen their marketing strategy, aside from that, it is also one good source of revenue. But not all good contents find their way to the right readers or community. Some of them would not even see the light of the day or their full advantage realized because of the fact that they were published in the wrong places or platform.

I came across a podcast interview of [*how you can find the right niche for your epic content*](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-find-perfect-niche-your-content-lessons-from-eofire-patankar/) and starting gaining the right traction.

**Here is a summary of that podcast episode**:

* Having a deep understanding of who you are writing for. Knowing who might find your contents helpful is really important for you to know where to publish it and what community to join in order for your writings to be appreciated. Knowing who frequently reads your contents also give you a really good idea of what another kind of contents you can produce.
* Perform a content audit in order to measure the success of the posts you are making. How many shares, likes, and tweets it's getting from different social media platforms and the comments that come in. During a content audit, you get an idea if whether you really have the right people receiving your contents. This process also helps you realize what contents you produce are actually being appreciated. This way, you can narrow down the kind of writings you produce rather than writing about all things under the sun.
* Listen to the feedback from your readers and general audience in order to create the right format and design when doing other contents such as webinars and ebooks. Writing about what they want to know about is what will work for you too. Do not forget to run tests as well in order to have solid data that you can use for your case studies.
* Establish a community of your own where people will find it really amazing to be part of. For most, when they gain a huge audience, they establish support systems and groups where readers and participants can actually ask some kind of professional and support. 
* Establish a good team of people who have the right skills to help you with your content creation effort and everything it entails such as the research, marketing, formatting and designing, all those small things that need doing so you can focus on content creation.
* Lastly, find the right tools for your content creation in order to help you and your team. Cutting edge technology really plays a huge role when it comes to helping you gain more traction concerning your writing.",2018-05-28 16:05:18

Anyone else using Google Docs and Google Voice to draft your content,12,7zlrd7,https://www.reddit.com/r/content_marketing/comments/7zlrd7/anyone_else_using_google_docs_and_google_voice_to/,3,1519392856.0,"If you’re like me you probably don’t have tons of time to sit down write lots of content.

There just doesn’t seem to be enough time in the day to get everything that needs to be done, done.

I also find it harder to get those fingers going as fast as my brain can come up with ideas. When I type, it sometimes results in ideas disappearing out of my brain, never to return and be put on the page.

Over the last few months, I’ve started to turn out a ton of content. My secret sauce, Google Docs, and Google Voice.

If you have Google Docs which is free with any Gmail account or if you use the GSuite you have it as well.

One of the best features of Google Docs is Google Voice. You can simply talk into your smartphone or into your computer and Google just types out what you’re saying.

I find that I can talk my ideas through a lot faster than actually typing them. Google Voice gives me a great tool in being able to just simply talk away and get all my ideas out of my head and onto the page.

This is one of my most invaluable tools. It just simply works and getting huge amounts of content completed can be done in mere minutes rather than staring at a blank screen trying to type as fast as my thoughts come out.

Anyone else doing this or tried this?",2018-02-23 07:34:16
"I'm making a free alternative to Buffer/Hootsuite, just released the beta on android..",11,5dxl8r,https://www.reddit.com/r/content_marketing/comments/5dxl8r/im_making_a_free_alternative_to_bufferhootsuite/,11,1479668723.0,"Before moving on, I'd like to reiterate that this app will forever be free (no ads/IAPs/shady permissions) and maybe even open source if anybody's interested in contributing. I don't have a very good portfolio to show to potential employers, I'm hoping this app changes that. Not to mention I originally built this for myself and have been using it for a while, but I asked around on reddit and people were interested so I'm releasing it.

It's just a small app, only works for twitter right now. I'll add Facebook, reddit, G+, instagram- the whole lot after my exams. I'm hoping this could be a decent free alternative to Buffer or Hootsuite for indies such as myself.

[Here](http://i.imgur.com/uXdM5ud.png)'s what it looks like, or [dark](http://i.imgur.com/KUZ59CF.png) if you prefer. I'm calling it 'AlphaPost' (If you can think of a clever name, let me know)

You can [import a CSV file](http://i.imgur.com/L5H6pzA.png) into the app (you can import 50k tweets for all I care, there's no limit), setup a posting schedule (just like buffer), schedule tweets to go out at specific times etc.

The app is in open beta, so expect a few bugs (If you're already using Buffer/Hootsuite, this app can safely work alongside those if you just want to try it out). I've been using it myself for weeks, seems to work fine. 

There is one 'catch' however. The app uses your device's internet (no server), so the app can only send the posts when the internet is working. If you have internet most of the day, everything will work just fine (If the WiFi is off, the app will turn it on and check and then turn it back off after posting because battery).

I'll be adding tons more features soon: more social networks, infinite profiles, support more complicated schedules, hashtag suggestions, maybe even something like quuu.co- sky's the limit :)

Someone shared some good top-level advice for kicking off a content strategy.

Let me know if there's anything you'd ad to it.

Did want to spam with a link, so I extracted the best bits below. In summary it covers 4 useful ways to prepare a content strategy.

**Identifying users**  
Before anything, it's important to identity what unique problems your target users face, what solutions they’re actively searching for, and what motivates them as individuals.

**Preparing content**  
This section of the post takes a deep dive into creating user funnels, then determining which forms of content will be suit each stage of a users lifecycle.

As an example, the top of your content funnel could include a video post with the objective of drive engagement. The bottom of your funnel could use a paid ad to acquire subscribers.

**Collaboration**  
Some of the best content insights can come from others within your industry. These can be unique discussions they have with users to identify new pain points.

**Distribution**  
Creating content is only half of the process involved in an effective strategy. If beautiful content isn’t properly distributed, it could quickly become obsolete.

An effective way to start distributing content is to allocate a small ad spend across each ad platform you deem relevant. By reviewing the performance of each platform, you can uncover which channel hosts the most effective results.

Hope this summary of the article is able to provide some valuable insights. Would be keen to know if it's missing anything you've found useful from your own experience.",2019-09-26 13:46:59

How To Social Media Market - A Historical College,10,csn6nw,https://www.reddit.com/r/content_marketing/comments/csn6nw/how_to_social_media_market_a_historical_college/,3,1566276695.0," 

Hi guys, I would like some marketing advice (in terms of social media - other areas are welcomed but social media the main concern).

I'm working for a college, it's a historical site in my country and it's primarily used to teach/train priests. The property is vast, beautiful and peaceful. It's one big architecture site, the site which tourists/locals can visit, take tours or just stay on the outside. To visitors, it's somewhat like visiting a museum, seeing a historical site, learning about history.

The actual site which tourists/locals are allowed to visit is the main area with the college which is basically one big building. It's centuries-old, beautiful architecture that has stood the test of time, which great history behind it. It's from the plantation days and the owner left it to a trust, with the intention of it becoming a school.

Now, we're having some issues and the board would like to increase traffic coming in. A little about the place: We have a restaurant, a newly installed giftshop, amazing coastal views, a pond with ducks, turtles and numerous koi fish. Lovely, HUGE, palm trees and other trees I fail to know the name of. Our lawns are spacious and green.

There's a fee for staying outside and going on the inside on a self-guided tour or tour. As it stands, I'm currently an intern I've done graphic work for them and now I'm apart of the marketing team which consists of myself, another intern and our boss. Now I've had some experience in social media marketing before, (which was one of the reasons why I was chosen) but not on a scale such as this, especially with a business easier to market. I've read posts and reports from here and I know some marketing from school and my management classes.

However, I want to find the right strategy for this place, even though my boss does not seem to want to meet or create and wishes to dump everything onto us interns to solve, create the ideas and bring to him.

On social media I know just posting isn't the right way to raise brand awareness. I personally intend to if possible, search for my country's tag on IG and look for tourists who are visiting and using that tag, like/comment on their posts maybe even follow and try to build a relationship with them and ask them to visit us to enhance their stay, etc. I want to also reach out to booking companies who recommend hotels/tours/certain locations and have them recommend us or have our brochures implemented in their place of business. (I also want to place brochures etc at tourists attractions/stores if possible).

Currently, this place does not push their social media/website. I want to change the way visitation/tours work. By:

1. Getting pictures of tourists/visitors enjoying the property/tours so we can use in future promotions or on social media

3. Create relevant memes that enforce our image (We have ducks, let's give a duck a personality call it Jim, I'm not sure but anything that may attract kids)
4. Ask visitors/Tourists for feedback (what can we do better/how can we do better/did you enjoy etc etc)

2. Increase tourists.

I realise I make typos, grammatical mistakes, and missing words mistakes frequently, especially when the content gets longer and longer. 

Every time someone points out a mistake I made, or I spot it after publishing that content, I cringe, correct the error, and beat myself over it. You can even say I (to a certain extent) live and die by my mistakes. It sucks when I get criticised as careless and not meticulous. 

I am also a one man show (most of the time). I write, proofread, and edit my own work. Ideally I would get it read by someone else before I send the work for approval or get it published, but most of the time it's not possible. 

I want to reduce my error rate.

Question about hub and spoke content strategy,10,bthjfo,https://www.reddit.com/r/content_marketing/comments/bthjfo/question_about_hub_and_spoke_content_strategy/,4,1558959504.0,"Hi all,

I've been researching the hub and spoke strategy and there's one thing I'm still trying to wrap my head around that I'd like to clarify.

Here is this advice that I'm confused about:

**You can employ a hub and spoke model for each month, or whatever works best for your ability to output content. As an example, if it’s a month, have your initial hub released on day one of the first week, followed by a blog every two days.**

1. What's the purpose of posting the hub first and then staggering the posting of spoke content? I've seen this advice on a lot of different articles too but none explain why.

2. For each sub-topic (spoke), how much detail should I go into in the long-form hub article? I assume in the main article, I should only give a rough overview of each sub-topic and provide links to my other blog posts/articles at the end. These other blog posts/articles should then go into a lot more detail? Or should the hub go into detail for each sub-topic?

In each of my past three positions, I've gone about tackling this differently in each instance, for a number of different reasons. Different stake holders, culture, resources, etc, can all have a major impact on where you start with content, why, and how you'll build and scale from there.

In my current situtation--the opportunity I'm heading to now--I'll have pretty much more freedom to do what I will with content for the organization than I've ever been given in the past.

SO, my question is, when you have the opportunity to build a content strategy from scratch, where is your favorite (where is the best) place to start? Do you like to tackle it from an SEO perspective? Do you start by outlining buyer journeys? Are you building personas first?

Our service finds her a traveler who is going to Paris and buys it for her, and the traveler can make money by completing the task, buys the requested lipstick and delivers to her.

We think getting travelers is a key for the service to make more matches. We've worked on content marketing to get more travelers using Twitter, IG, FB, ProductHunt and Reddit, so far.

Actually, it been hard to get travelers who actually sign up for our service, so we're thinking to target bloggers who write about travels, and budget to promote our service as their readers can be our potential users. However, we have to pay bloggers if they already have a lot of readers even though we are still in early stage and try to save as much money as possible.

Do you think paying bloggers who have a ton of readers to promote our service at this stage is good idea? If not, what alternative approaches we should take?

I'd like to build an email list with GetResponse,11,ex6dhz,https://www.reddit.com/r/content_marketing/comments/ex6dhz/id_like_to_build_an_email_list_with_getresponse/,12,1580593813.0," 

Hey Reddit!

So I want to build an email list. This is how I want to achieve that.

Build  a 2-page landing page that is offering a free mini-course which will be  sent out on email for 5 days. So basically, they’ll have lessons for 5  days. So day 1, lesson 1 is sent until the 5th day. A total of 5  lessons.

That landing page will have an opt in form with two fields where the visitors can put their first name and email address.

There will also be a submit button after the form that probably says, “get the free course now.”

Once they click that button, they will be taken to the second page which will be a thank you page.

After  that, I want them to immediately receive an email from me welcoming  them and also asking them to confirm their email address so that their  free course can be activated.

Once they confirm their email, I want them to receive their first lesson the next day.

They will then continue receiving the lessons for the next five days. After that, I’ll now be sending them weekly newsletters.

PS:  I want those emails to be personalized. I will be including their first  names as I send them out. Plus, I will be scheduling the emails in  advance.

So here’s my concern: I  know GetResponse can do everything above. My only worry is whether the  emails will make it in the primary folder and not be marked off as spam  or promotional.

Of course I’m not selling them anything at the moment, I’m just trying to build a list for future use.

Anyone here who has used GetResponse before? How can I avoid my emails going to the spam/promotional folder?

Would I need additional hosting and a domain name? What else is needed?

I’m using the free version but I’m planning to upgrade really soon.

I’d appreciate any insights. Thanks!",2020-02-01 15:50:13

Is this benchmark for the content writing team fair?,9,dnft86,https://www.reddit.com/r/content_marketing/comments/dnft86/is_this_benchmark_for_the_content_writing_team/,31,1572134794.0,"**Please - what are the benchmarks for content writers where you work?**

I'm trying to set benchmarks for realistic output from in-house content writers. At the moment I'm playing with this:

* 500 well-written words = 3 hours

Plus 20% down time for responding to emails, coffee breaks, etc, because people need some slack. (This 80% output level was a benchmark we used in a digital marketing agency and nobody ever batted an eyelid).

That would mean a 1,500 word article would take 10.8 hours to write (or about a day and a half, once you factor in lunch). And that's 138.9 words/hour.

Elsewhere on here I've seen a manager mention a target of ""1,100 words a day"" (which amounts to 137.5 words an hour if you assume an 8-hour working day).

Whatcha think? Is my expectation fair?

**Edit:**

For clarity, this benchmark would apply to:

* SEO category pages of around 1,200 words = just under 9 hours/1.5 working days)
* Longer form blog posts of up to 3,000 words = about 22 hours (3 working days)
* A month's social posts, at around 500 words = 3.5  hours for 30 posts of 15 words (a morning or afternoon)

Also for clarity:

This benchmark is for basic fact research and (proofread) **writing only.** i.e. not topic research, not editing, not image sourcing.

The actual plan is to use the benchmarks as a general guideline. Their biggest application would be for mapping out project timelines and managing capacity rather than as a stick to beat people with.

So (for example) if we believe it takes 1.5 days to write a 1,500 word post, then we could say

* Monday - research and briefing (multiple articles) - (SEO)
* **Tuesday & Wednesday** ***(actually 2 days)*** **- writing (Content)**
* Thursday - Stakeholder review (Sales, SEO, Content)
* Friday - amendments, implementation & publishing (Content & Dev)",2019-10-26 19:06:34

I (F23) work at a start up for a water bottle company as the digital media manager, and last night I was the director for my first ever photoshoot. We had four models, me, and the photographer. We were taking photos at the local airport to show that the water bottle was a great option for travel, long story short. I created a project brief with a casual list of different shots to take (such as ""filling up at water fill station"", ""walking into airport"", etc.) Nothing too detailed at all, no models with certain actions specified, etc. I also planned this entire shoot in 48 hours- big mistake... models were bailing last minute, we had almost no budget for props, etc. So a lot of these factors weren't helpful in aiding to the overall success of the photoshoot. But as far as my responsibilities go... I blew it. I felt that it was a total disaster. I'd like to think I'm a pretty creative person and I honestly just really thought ideas for shots and the creative would come to me in the moment, but at the shoot I drew multiple blanks... so many times. The photographer was great and totally saved the day, thankfully, so the shots came out and everything; but no thanks to me at all. I've never been in a position of that much responsibility and have never had multiple people looking at my saying, ""okay, now what?"" And I just didn't realize how it would feel to have all the answers dependent on me. Looking back it makes sense, and I guess how would I have known until I did it for the first time... but I still feel embarrassed and terrible. The photographer said they felt, ""stuck and alone"", and they were asking questions like, ""what's the story here...?"", etc.

Does anyone have any advice on how to avoid standing there like an idiot next time? Of course things like planning time and better models will help, but anything you guys do to help spark creativity? Should I be literally writing out EVERY specific shot that needs to be taken and have 50+ ready to go and written down, so that I'm not at a loss on the shoot? I was standing there basically saying, ""Okay... I guess hold the water bottle here now...?"" I can't believe how ill-equipped I felt. I'm legitimately very embarrassed and would love some advice on how you guys prepare to direct a photoshoot to help me do better next time. I know I can do this, I'm creative and I think I have the personality for it, I just need to be 50x more prepared than I was. Not everything will just come to me in the moment apparently.

Insights about giveaways/competitions,10,c0u9h3,https://www.reddit.com/r/content_marketing/comments/c0u9h3/insights_about_giveawayscompetitions/,5,1560608074.0,"I am trying to get some marketing of the ground for my webapp and have been experimenting with some giveaways here on reddit. 

The webapp allows you to create small puzzles with a message embedded into them. The interesting thing is that the message cannot be read without solving the puzzle (this is cryptographically  ensured), so it actually is quite a good medium for giveaways. You can embed a link/message in the puzzle and only the one(s) that solves the puzzle can read it.

By some experiments I distilled the following 'rules' to increase user participation:

1) Make the puzzles fun to solve - at some point I had a puzzle that was too hard and frustrating, which reduced the level of participation and got some people a bit gruntled.

2) Have multiple puzzles of increasing difficulty - This way the competitors have a 'second' chance.

3) Have a prize for someone solving all puzzles - Now people are compelled to do the 'easier' ones which increases participation (at least in my metrics ;) ).

4) Monitor the competition closely, and respond nicely to people (even to the ones you think are 'trying to bend the rules a bit')

&#x200B;

These were my conclusions from some small scale experiments, please let me know if you have other suggestions/insights that I can use.

Everything you should Know about Instagram Screen-shot Notification,9,bxdkne,https://www.reddit.com/r/content_marketing/comments/bxdkne/everything_you_should_know_about_instagram/,1,1559832526.0,"**With the massive volume of appealing content on Instagram, it is more than tempting for people to take screen-shot or records of what is displayed for them. At the beginning of 2018, Instagram ran a test for some three months to send notifications on screen-shots of stories. Due to the negative feedback from users, Instagram Screen-shot Notification feature which started in February 2018, was rolled back by June, the same year.**

**This is how it worked:** 

when someone took a screen-shot from another user’s content, there went a notification to the post owner and informed them about which content from, by whom and when the screen-shot was taken. While this feature was welcomed by some privacy-lover users, other “screen-shotters” seemed to be annoyed by the fact that their “privacy” was endangered.

## Where is Instagram Screen-shot Notification right now?

Right now, **Instagram sends no notification for screen-shots** taken of your content. However, there is an exception for disappearing photos and videos in the Direct Message. **Disappearing photos and videos** are the ones you take by the Instagram camera and send them directly through the direct message. If any of your contacts take a screen-shot from these disappearing photos you have sent them, Instagram will send you a notification.The phrase “photo you sent” in the image above is exactly related to a disappearing photo in DM.

So, you will receive:

* **no screen-shot notification on posted photos and videos;**
* **no screen-shot notification on stories;**
* **no screen-shot notification on lives,**
* **no screen-shot notification on non-disappearing photos in DM; and**
* **a screen-shot notification on a disappearing picture in DM.**

You might want to consider:

* **Using the “bookmark” option under the posts, instead of taking screen-shots:** to do this, you only need to tap the bookmark sign under the photo or video. By doing this, the content is stored in the bookmark section of your Instagram account, and you can go back to it whenever you want. The only downturn of this method is that if the owner deletes the post, your bookmark will also get deleted.
* **Not using any third party app that claim to send you Instagram Screen-shot Notification:** these kinds of apps are either scammers or are lying to rob you. Do not install and use them under any condition; else the security of both your Instagram account and your device might fall at risk.

**A side thought...**

It might not be a bad idea if Instagram considers running the feature more seriously and not stopping it again, any time in the future. This Instagram Screen-shot Notification feature makes people to more carefully observe the copyright of contents and encourages more individuals to create their own unique posts.In addition, the fact that Instagram stopped this feature in 2018 doesn't mean that they won’t initialize it again. Instagram Screen-shot Notification feature might get enabled anytime without you even knowing about it.",2019-06-06 09:48:46

Its a local Yamaha Dealership and so the first ads that I ran on Facebook were just target to the city and no targeting other than that. A month ago I got a job at Glassbow as a digital marketer. 

So while I am learning this stuff I decided to document my work and failures and successes.

It was an E-commerce brand, so we started Send-to-Messenger[ ](https://www.chatchamp.com/blueprintdownload?utm_campaign=Make+more+money+with+facebook&utm_medium=answer&utm_source=quora)ads.

They used the S2M ad to prompt a quiz, then a product was recommended based on the quiz results. Later, they could retarget those users in Messenger with abandoned cart reminders and also send them relevant content based on their product recommendations. In this case, the product was a nutritional supplement, and they targeted their customers later with recipes.

Currently I am a digital content strategist and pretty much in every job I have been responsible for managing website launches, and also managing the launch of new pages, including the layouts and content. Most of my career I have been responsible for implementing SEO, analyzing data in Google Analytics, Google AdWords, SEMRush, Crazy Egg, BuzzSumo, etc to help build the digital content strategy. But a big chunk of my job (since they all always had the word 'Content' in them) is writing. Writing case studies, writing we summaries, I would say 50%-75% of my job is writing depending on the company.

The thing is I really love the research side of things. I studied architecture (traditional architecture, you know buildings) so I have always had my mind geared towards analyzing how users will experience a place. I minored in Sociology and even then I loved projects where I had to go out and observe human behavior. Even down to my apartment I did the research of how colors can effect me psychologically, and came up with a triad color scheme that is minimalist for each.

While I love the content strategy side of things, what I really LOVE is when I do my research and analyze data on how people are using our website and the behavior of people searching for key terms. I am lucky that I have the opportunity to implement UX Research into my current work when I build new pages in our CMS, but it's limited. With that being said, I am trying to get away from the constant writing side of things for content, and wanting to focus on more of the research side, which is the direction I want my career to go in.

Best way to learn writing skills for content marketing?,8,9wlk2d,https://www.reddit.com/r/content_marketing/comments/9wlk2d/best_way_to_learn_writing_skills_for_content/,24,1542110008.0,"I have been doing freelance blogs for a small content marketing start-up on and off for about 3 years since I was a senior in college (like, maybe an article every 2 or 3 weeks with long stretches of no activity). I got into it through someone my dad knew pretty much. These were mostly 450-550 word blogs for client sites which were really just reworded from briefs. I'm an ok writer but with these I wasn't ever that concerned about the writing quality beyond getting the grammar and punctuation correct.

&#x200B;

Recently the company reached out to me to write an independent article for them each week on a topic for an industry related to one I used to work in. There are no briefs and I either am given a topic to write on and do the research myself or come up with an idea and do the research. They often want to include quotes from people within the industry for these articles. I am credited with the writing and get paid a decent market rate for a beginner for these articles (works out to around $.08 per word typically). I agreed because I thought it would be a good opportunity to get something with my name out there and hone my skills.

&#x200B;

However, I didn't study anything related to journalism, marketing or writing and feeling a little lost with these articles. I am having a hard time reaching out for quotes from people other than those I already know (I have a handful of industry contacts, but not a ton) so I end up just referencing a lot of online content for research. In addition I don't know where to begin with trying to become a better content writer or learning best practices in the industry without dropping $1500 on some kind of certificate. This is something I do in my spare time and is not related to my full-time job. Obviously, Google yields hundreds of thousands of results for ""how to learn content marketing"" but I don't even know where to begin with these as they are mostly advertising certificate courses or are listicles that tell you what to learn but not where/how. Most results I see are also geared toward people doing content marketing as a full-time career whereas I am only doing the writing portion and not dealing with the SEO/analytics side of things.

&#x200B;

Do any of you have any books, free online resources, or other reasonably-priced but worthwhile online courses you know about that would teach the basics of writing original content marketing articles and improving the quality of my writing? My goal (at least right now) is not to turn this into a full-time career, but if I am going to be working on a weekly article published under my name I figure I might as well try to improve.",2018-11-13 05:53:28

I work as a social media manager from 2013. I worked with multiple different clients all over the world but my most important experiences are with two startups. One is a luxury brand startup and another one is a tech startup.

What I did as part of my experience:
- creating customer personas
- creating website content strategy by buyers journey
- Creating the content plan for social media and the website
- optimizing website content for the conversion
- Managing multiple people (translators, writers, graphic designers, website developers, PPC experts etc)
- Creating visual content for social media (including videos, lead magnets)
- Running e-mail campaigns and newsletters
- Managing and organizing influencer collaborations and online PR
- Running smaller ads campaigns for Facebook, Instagram, and Pinterest
- Determining KPIs and following up with monthly and yearly reporting

I did all of this for 15$ per hour.
I feel now it's the time to start charging a bit more. My ideal rate would be 20-25$ per hour.

However, I don't know how to pack my services and which title I should have based on everything I am doing.

And well-intended tinkering can make things worse.

Here are some tips on creating great headline I've found and try not to forget using:

1. **Reboot your brain**. Look for fresh usages of the term you’re writing about, not necessarily articles at this point. Recalibrate your brain as a way of resetting the topic.
2.  **Use power words.**
 * You or Your,
 * Free
 * Because
 * Imagine
 * New
 * Secrets / Myths
 * If you can’t work with any of the above, ask a question.
 * Reminder: Headlines do not to have to be logical. In fact, many great headlines are fairly nonsensical! Get out of your rational mind to allow more room for creativity. You can always revert back.

3. **Remove your personal bias.** Use Google Survey and let anonymous users tell you what headlines work best.

4. **Headline prototyping**. Start writing headlines using “free association” and the ideas I intentionally added to my short-term memory.

5. **Idea harvesting.** Do several regular Google searches for things like “brilliant headlines,” “headlines that sell,” “nonsense headlines that work,” and so on.

6. **Layout the tools and caveats.** It’s really good to be honest with yourself about any flaws that could lead to self sabotage.

While more than 80% of businesses claim to have a [content marketing](https://www.webolutions.com/content-marketing/) program in place, only 30% rate their programs as effective according to the 2016 Content Marketing Institute (CMI) Benchmarking Study.

Top Content Marketing Trends and Challenges

So why the low effectiveness ratings? Content marketing is still a relatively new discipline and many marketing departments haven’t fully made the organizational pivot required for content marketing excellence. Some of the top challenges include:

Lack of Resources/Unclear Ownership: 50% of businesses have no dedicated staff to manage their content marketing programs which makes content creation and distribution yet another time- consuming task on top of already stressed resources. Many respondents expressed concerns about their ability to find trained content marketing professionals.

Lack of Clear Strategy: Only 32% of businesses claim to have a documented content marketing strategy in place. Those organizations with a strategy have significantly higher confidence in their program effectiveness.

Volume of Web Content Exploding: With seismic increases in the amount of content available, it is becoming increasingly difficult to guarantee return on content development efforts. Algorithms are rewarding higher quality content vs. keyword-stuffed articles and ad-blocking is making it more difficult to get paid content views.

Difficult to Measure Impact: Only 21% of marketers claim they are successful at measuring impact, in part due to difficulty in linking content viewership with sales and in part because of lack of time to devote to program analysis and tracking.

Content Matters

Just because content marketing is difficult, doesn’t mean marketers are giving up. 76% of CMI survey respondents say they will produce more content in 2016 because the data suggests content marketing delivers. In 2015, Hubspot performed a Benchmark Analysis of more than 7,000 businesses to quantify the impact of content marketing. Below are some of the key takeaways:

•	Companies with 51-100 website pages generate 48% more traffic than those with under 50
•	B2B & B2C companies with 101-200 website pages generate 5x more leads than those with under 50
•	B2B companies that blog just 2x/month generate 70% more leads than those who don’t blog
•	Companies that increase blogging from 3-5x to 6-8x/month nearly double their leads
•	Companies with 51-100 Twitter followers generate 106% more traffic than those with under 25
•	Companies saw a 185% increase in traffic after crossing 1,000 Facebook likes

Key Content Marketing Trends For 2016

A number of important trends will impact content marketers in 2016. Some reflect the growing maturity of the discipline and others are in response to technology advances and user preferences.

Shift in focus from Quantity to Quality

While the Hubspot data above stresses the importance of meeting certain content quantity thresholds, many organizations are shifting focus from sheer quantity to improved content quality. More organizations are creating content marketing strategies that narrow their focus to those items that yield the best results in terms of web visits, downloads, shares and other quantifiable calls to action. They are looking to create content that addresses each stage of the sales funnel to both generate leads and nurture them along. Content marketers are also focused on better repurposing of existing content and ideas. Given the increased difficulty in getting viewership, businesses need to maximize visibility of one theme before moving on to the next.

Greater Emphasis on Visual Content

With more and more content being consumed on mobile devices, user preference is migrating to more easily digestible visual content. YouTube visitors consume more than 4B video views per day. Websites are increasingly incorporating video as a key component of home page design and many companies are adding vlogging in addition to published blogs. Other forms of visual content are also on the rise including infographics, animated GIFs, short-form videos and real-time storytelling on platforms like Periscope and Meerkat.

ROI-Based Measurement

With content marketing now accounting for 28% of overall marketing spending, management is demanding better tracking of program performance. Content marketers need to determine the key performance metrics that matter most and take the time to analyze results. According to CMI, businesses are increasingly focused on lead generation and sales as the primary measures of content marketing program success with brand awareness and engagement as secondary. Improved use of marketing automation technology is helping content marketers better link content viewership with not only lead generation, but right through to the end sale. This focus on ROI is helping marketers understand which content drives the highest quality leads both in terms of interest and urgency to help refine strategy over time.

Content Personalization

Content personalization has been proven to drive better conversion. Consider the examples below:
•	The average website conversion rate is just 2%
•	Personalized web experiences drive an average increase of 20% in sales
•	35% of Amazon’s revenue is generated by its recommendation engine
•	75% of users select movies based on Netflix recommendations
•	Personalized calls to action (CTAs) resulted in 42% higher conversion than generic CTAs
Content marketers will look for more ways to personalize content in the coming year. Common tactics include customized landing pages and dynamic website content where the tools can serve up a customized message based on the IP address of the visitor or the ad they clicked to get to the page. Personalization can also be achieved based on improved segmentation of content by persona vs. delivering of one-size-fits-all messaging. For example, one pet food company was able to achieve substantial sales increases by segmenting dog owners by the size of their pet.  Messaging to owners of lap dogs looked very different than what they served up to Labrador owners. Lookalike-inspired segmentation allows marketers to find and deliver messages to audiences that look like their current customer base.

The importance of content marketing continues to grow and 2016 is the time to start refining your program.

7 Advanced Ways to Reduce Email Unsubscribe Rates,10,5ynlov,https://www.reddit.com/r/content_marketing/comments/5ynlov/7_advanced_ways_to_reduce_email_unsubscribe_rates/,1,1489197771.0,"With email marketing driving more conversions than any other marketing channel, there’s never been a more important time to reduce email unsubscribe rates within your business.  

The truth is, while you can’t always prevent readers from opting out of your emails, you can reduce the likelihood of them doing so with a few proven practices.

I decided to dig in on the subject, and research what many influencers are doing to reduce email churn nurture a better relationship with their audience.

I've narrowed it down to 7 key factors

* Set the expectation for when you're going to email - People value consistency in others. (Paul Jarvis does this perfectly)
* Use a combination of single and double optins - Use single optins for content upgrades and double optins for everything else, and try to stand out with your confirmation email.
* Segment your list by interest - Use segments in your email marketing software and send targeted emails to reduce readers opting out.
* Use normal subject lines - Write to your audience like you would a friend or work colleague (read: no sneaky tactics).
* Revise your copy - Revise your footer copy so readers have more choices when it comes to opting out of your newsletter.
* Send a follow-up email - Give departing readers a reason to stick around (even if that includes following you on social media)
* Ask for feedback - Follow up with departing readers by asking them why they unsubscribed. (Protip: split test how you ask them.) 

I've written a 2400 words monster with all the learnings I did by researching influencers. The article includes examples and my personal swipe file with thank you pages (Which is an effective, yet unknown way to reduce email churn).

What are my options here?

I really don't want to go back through to edit and optimize because it would take ages and nobody is viewing this content anyway (each post might get 20 page views in a month).

I've considered just deleting all of these old posts and then setting up redirects to the homepage or to the ""news"" blog landing page. But I'm not sure what the impact of that might be in terms of the site's health and domain authority.

Currently debating 3 different social media tracking services... advice?,8,ejkyuw,https://www.reddit.com/r/content_marketing/comments/ejkyuw/currently_debating_3_different_social_media/,10,1578111110.0,"I'm trying to pick software to better help me manage my companies social media, and have it boiled down to 3 options that look attractive.

Sendible, 100/month

SocialPilot, 50/month

It's a bit hard to compare because I feel like they use different terms for some of the same things, so it's tricky to see from the outside which one truly offers the most value. At a glance SocialPilot looks like it offers everything I need for half the price as the other two, but that also makes me wonder why it's so much cheaper. Hoping some folks here may have experience with any of these who could shed some light?

About my potential use: Currently focus on our IG and Facebook, also passively my CEO's LinkedIn, and occasionally our company Twitter. Might ramp up Twitter usage if I can find value via analytics. In 2019 my main focus with our IG was recruiting and public image, but we're dialing back on recruiting so I'll be shifting more towards curating a stronger local culture presence. And FB is always primarily for engaging with current and potential customers.

I started at the company in June 2018 as a PPC specialist, however in November the person who was our content specialist left. I took over the role and like it a lot more than the PPC stuff.

The company is small so I guess you'll just be told if you're not doing well and otherwise just keep doing what you're doing. I don't agree with this but whatever.

My question is, how do I go about asking for a raise, and a significant one at that, without having a yearly review? I'm not just asking because it's been a year and I want more money, I honestly believe I've done a lot of good work for the company.

1. There's one person who markets herself as an ""[industry] journalist"" who has not only published near-copies of my unique, high-performing articles but has then sold them elsewhere. I got one of the sites she *sold* my transformed article to (syndicated from her site) briefly DMCA'd for plagiarism. But my boss doesn't want to bring it up against her company or employer, because we have a distant affiliate relationship with them. He did spring for Copyscape, offering to do something if that raised alarms, but Copyscape couldn't find similarity if you put it up to a fucking mirror.

2. A few minutes ago I found someone on two mid-size subreddits with a SHITTY 1 man affiliate site getting praise for an article that he seems to have stolen from us. The very unique stock photo is the same, the title is the same (plus some) and the article topic is the same (plus more added). And it's having way more success on social because it's unbranded.

I'm just here to vent, because I typed a devastating plagiarism callout and tagged the relevant mods but can't imagine actually sending it. If my risk-averse company saw me taking down this fool they'd be angrier at me than anyone else.

&#x200B;

I am starting out on the content marketing front, and am planning on a strategic content publication routine.

&#x200B;

What I am doing is: first I create a blog post on my primary platform (assuming it's my business blog built on wordpress), then distribute it to multiple platforms to increase inbound traffic. These are the platforms on my mind: LinkedIn, Facebook, Medium, etc.

&#x200B;

One thing I found both tedious and (therefore?) error-prone is: synchronizing existing content on my primary platform to other platforms, manually. Yes, I know you can use the Import feature in Medium to import an existing post via a url, pretty neat indeed. However, this still is a manual process, and you have to repeat this process for all the platforms that offer the import feature. For those who don't, you will need to spend more time copying/pasting, etc.

&#x200B;

I'd like to automate this process as much as possible: once I am done with the content on my primary platform, I'd like to hit a magic button which publishes the content to all the other target platforms.

&#x200B;

If you take subsequent post updates into account, this would seem even more appealing: after updates are made, hit the button again, and woot, all of a sudden, all the platforms are updated!

1. Create a social media campaign for a cause (climate change, bullying, etc.)

2. Create a social media campaign for a person who was not alive when social media existed (Sigmund Freud, Marilyn Monroe, Thomas Paine...the choices are endless)

"Opened a business last year, which was a success, now thinking about getting an agency on board - advice wanted!",7,ac6ckj,https://www.reddit.com/r/content_marketing/comments/ac6ckj/opened_a_business_last_year_which_was_a_success/,7,1546555723.0,"Hi Reddit!

&#x200B;

Long time lurker, first-time poster here - Thank you for all the amazing content & knowledge spread around here. I'd also like to apologize for any language mistakes that this text might have - English is not my first language, so please bear with me :)!

&#x200B;

First, a little background: In 2018, together with my brother, we have finally opened the start-up project that we have been working on since 2014.  We are an aquatic sports hub, as well as a recreational venue for friends & families. Our offer primarily centers around watersport activities, such as Wakeboard, Inflatable water park (like this), Kayaking & SUP's. We also have a seasonal bar & restaurant, serving some of the regions best burgers. We organize events & parties, from live music, through birthdays to private events for groups. We are located in the South of Spain, around the Mojacar area. 

&#x200B;

The business in itself is a success, and our business model was verified in our first year of operation, with some very high return rates on certain activities and offering. In the high season (from late May to September) we are getting a good number of visits, with minimal marketing effort (our marketing budget in the first year was around 2,000 euro in total, including all stationaries & branding, some done in-house, and some contracted). 

&#x200B;

However, outside of the high season, we could really use help in the promotion of our business both online & offline. With the business growing, I am having less time & energy to push the marketing effort, and I am considering looking for a marketing agency that would help me with managing a couple of posts a week on Facebook & Instagram (I know that's vague, but that's due to my lack of experience). I would also like them to help me with preparing & managing event pages. 

&#x200B;

Now, I lack experience in employing marketing agencies - I do not know what I should look for, and what I should watch out for. I have no idea what are ""good"" prices, and what is a ""rip-off"" price for marketing services. I am looking for feedback from people who have decided to go through and hire a marketing agency and hear what worked, and what did not. Any ""Red flags"" or things that you wish you knew/had thought about before would be greatly appreciated. I am happy to provide more information, as well as links to my business's website & social media profiles, but I do not want you guys to think that I am trying to advertise for it.

Top Content Marketing Agencies Align to the Buyer’s Journey.

Sadly, I may also have seen some of the worst. There are a few things that set them apart. One of the most undeniable differences is the agencies understanding of the buyer’s journey, and how to align content to each of the stages. The underlying principle behind this is the desire to create content that supports what the buyer wants no matter where they are in their search, as well as to guide them down a path to purchase.

I generally look at the buyer’s journey as broken down into three stages: Awareness, Consideration, and Decision. The image below breaks down these sections, and explores what the buyer is going through at each stage:

If so, how much do you pay per piece or a well-researched, data-filled article?  


I've personally tried both by having an in-house writing team and hiring freelancers. In-house writers take longer. There is also a certain level of expertise that is difficult to get with only using your team. My blog has content around economic and legal heavy topics. I'm not an economist or lawyer, so obviously I would want to hire a freelancer that is more knowledgable than me.  


I've used Upwork and Fiverr in the past however I've been scammed multiple times by someone who claims to be a legal expert in the US but is really a ghost writer in Uganda or something.

Your view and philosophy on marketing fatigue,8,71ij25,https://www.reddit.com/r/content_marketing/comments/71ij25/your_view_and_philosophy_on_marketing_fatigue/,6,1506022725.0,"Hi everybody,

I have a question for all the content marketeers out here.
The last couple of month I have been working on setting up a small business in contentmarketing/seo with the emphasis on entertainment for content.

After the death of my business partner I quit the field but I feel I am ready to begin anew and have been working on it for a while.
During all the planning, thinking, building, creating and researching a feeling kept creeping up on me. The sensation of redundancy of content and its purpose in our own market as marketeers.

Looking at a lot of questions and post on this sub and others subs that are related I feel that al lot of content is just a reworded copy to get eyes on your website as a marketeer. But almost none of those are unique or original. I mean I get it, we all are fishermen in the same fishbowl so we use the same bait.

But the content is so uninspiring that I hesitate to even take a wild guess as how many of the post actually give any results for the company that places them on this sub or others. 

So the feeling I got is that many might not be satisfied or happy in their work. 

I love writing and creating, but looking at so many uninspiring and unoriginal content carrying the same titles that seem to start like: 10 things to know..this is what the top ten.., did you know..etc etc. 
It feels as if many are not even trying to get a personal view or insight but are fighting to make a living using tactics that feel so, lets say cramped up. 

As if it is creating by reflex instead of inspiration.

As I am sure many of you have been way longer in the field than I but since I am returning to the field, I wonder:
Do you recognize any of this or am I reading way to much into it? If you do recognize this, what is your philosophy on this?

Ps not a native English speaker so please do not feel to irritated by grammar and spelling mistakes :)",2017-09-21 14:38:45
Reciprocity is KING: How to use reciprocity in your marketing,8,6pt1wv,https://www.reddit.com/r/content_marketing/comments/6pt1wv/reciprocity_is_king_how_to_use_reciprocity_in/,2,1501151597.0,"Here’s a thought you might have had when told to give away quality work for free:

“Why should I give away stuff for free?”

“Isn’t that cheapening my brand? Don’t people only value things that they pay for?”

Not quite!

When you offer something first for free, if it’s helpful, people feel a real sense of indebtedness towards you.

This indebtedness is a real phenomenon, and it has a significant effect: Your subsequent requests would make them much more likely to return the favor.

Here are some ways you can utilize the [reciprocity principle](https://www.referralcandy.com/blog/reciprocity-marketing-examples/) in your marketing, with examples of successful companies that have done it:

###A. Offer something first: Allow them to feel indebted to you.

**1. Sparring Mind – Insightful blog articles**

One of the best reciprocity strategies is content marketing.

Blogging is a great way to utilize the reciprocity principle, as you are essentially giving away value for free in the form of blog posts. The challenge is to focus on being genuinely useful to your audience.

Gregory Ciotti’s Sparring Mind is a good example; it contains some of the most insightful articles on applied psychology in the workplace.

When your articles enable readers to yield results, they will be grateful to you, and are more likely to reciprocate by providing their email addresses for future blog updates. They become valuable leads in your funnel.

**2. Copyblogger – Free ebooks, articles, webinars, podcasts**

Copyblogger is another great example of content marketing.

They provide a ton of free content: blog articles, ebooks, seminars and webinars, which can be accessed with a free membership.

With so much goodies they’re offering you at no extra charge, you might want to consider returning the favor by signing up for their Authority membership, which costs approximately $1/day.

They even offer a 30-day risk-free Authority trial, with money-back guarantee! So no hard feelings.

**3. Helpscout – Free resources**

Free guides on customer acquisition, support and retention can be found on the Helpscout website.

They take the game a little further by giving you access without even asking for your email address!

When you start feeling half guilty that you’re actually able to read all their beautiful articles for free, a small popup appears in the corner of your screen, promising you more weekly articles like these.

**4. Spotify Premium free trial**

Spotify Premium: Ad-free music streaming with offline mobile access. [Spotify](https://www.referralcandy.com/blog/red-bull/) provides a 30-day free trial for their Premium membership, which can be cancelled at any time at no cost.

This makes it hard for people to stop the payment when the free trial ends, especially when it only costs $8/month.

**5. True&Co. – Free home try-on service**

True&Co. offers a home try-on service, where customers can have 5 different bras and 5 other items sent right to their doorstep.

Customers have the luxury of trying out lingerie for free in the comfort of their own home. At the end of 5 days, they only pay for what they keep, and return the rest of the items for free!

**6. Amazon - Free ebook samples for Kindle**

Amazon sells an amazing selection of ebooks for their Kindle devices and apps.

Customers can choose to download a free sample of any ebook, which is the first 10% of the book. The free samples never expire, so you can keep them for as long as you like until you decide to buy the full ebook.

###B. Offer something exclusive: Allow them to feel special.

Stuff that’s exclusive and never-before-seen-anywhere-else.

**7. Buffer – Acquired 100,000 users through guest blogging**

In an interview, the co-founder of BufferApp, Leo Widrich, mentioned that the 100,000 users gained through guest blogging were the result of about 150 guest posts.

Having exclusive blog partnerships with other companies and providing them with unique content not found on your own blog gives them something to be proud of.

They will be more than happy to return that favor, either by promoting that post more vigorously, or by guest posting on your blog in return.

###C. Personalize it: Make sure they know it’s from you.

**8. Red Bull**

Red Bull, the company that dropped a man from space, makes sure that their brand cannot be ignored.

From their massive banners are sporting events to the girls who give out free Red Bull drinks, their brand logo and colors are emblazoned everywhere.

**9. Converse's free recording studio**

In 2011, Converse set up a recording studio in Brooklyn, allowing emerging artists to sign up and record songs for free!

Many musicians find it hard to make a living, and Converse did a wonderful job in providing them with the opportunity to do so in a quality studio.

In order to amplify the effects of reciprocity, it is important to:

- Incite the feeling of indebtedness by offering first;
- Provide something exclusive and unique to the recipient so they feel special;
- Make sure they know it’s from you
- Also, don’t just give once. In the words of Dean Rieck:

The key is to create a feeling of debt and to maintain that feeling of debt.

The reciprocity principle seems straightforward: Give something, get something in return.

But it can get complicated.

It gets complicated because different people have different interpretations of what “free” or “no-strings-attached” means.

For instance: can free trials really be considered a reciprocity technique?

I had an interesting conversation with Lincoln Murphy (from Sixteen Ventures) about this. In Lincoln’s view, free trials aren’t unconditional because they expire after a given time. The user is then obligated to pay to keep using the product.

This perspective is completely valid. However, in my personal experience, I’ve had instances where I felt grateful for the opportunity to use a product before buying it. So it really depends on the perspective of the end-user.

How does YOUR customer feel about what you’re offering them?",2017-07-27 05:33:17

* Use Email Signature
* Invite users to subscribe before they checkout
* Subscribe via newsletter
* Optimize CTAs - Make it clear what people get
* Through physical stores
* Trough (free) social media
* Be the expert - Instead of giving away knowledge entirely for free, ask people for their email

Marketing an eBook but no one’s downloading.,6,esrb58,https://www.reddit.com/r/content_marketing/comments/esrb58/marketing_an_ebook_but_no_ones_downloading/,33,1579804390.0,"Hey guys I wanna explain a situation and then hear your thoughts and see if there’s any solutions I’m not thinking of.

The title explains the gist of it. I’m running an as campaign for an eBook on Facebook. I had originally wanted this to be a free offer so we could create a warm audience for further campaigns but my boss insisted on putting the eBook behind a mailing list, my first impression was “no one is going to download this if they have to sign up.” As we’re a small company that hasn’t run campaigns before, people aren’t aware of us so they see no benefit to a mailing list, they just want the damn eBook.

2 days in and we’re getting decent traction on the ads but surprise surprise, no one is signing up and getting the eBook.

What I’m thinking we could do are:

1. Ditch the mailing list all together and focus on this campaign generating a warm audience to retarget later once they’ve read the eBook and hopefully liked it.

2. The landing page has the mailing list form at the bottom with a button at the top taking you directly to it. We could move the form to the top so it’s directly in peoples faces and they aren’t being taken on that big a journey.

3. Giving people the option to just download the eBook OR download and sign up for a mailing list.

I’m a recent college graduate looking to get my foot in the door with a full-time position. In the 2 weeks that I’ve been applying places, I’ve only heard back from one company about an interview. Really felt like I was doing something wrong with my applications, so I did some digging and found out about ATS software. To get past initial screenings, I’ve been told to keep my resume as bland-looking as possible and use keywords from the posting. However, I’ve also been told by my college that with creative jobs it helps to be creative with resume design to catch the human eye that might be reading. Would love some opinions: boring-looking resume optimized for robots, or stylish resume optimized for humans?

Thought Leadership: What it is and why you need it,7,8lmrf3,https://www.reddit.com/r/content_marketing/comments/8lmrf3/thought_leadership_what_it_is_and_why_you_need_it/,4,1527136980.0,"Thought leadership is often thought of as a hybrid between content marketing and public relations, and while there is some overlap, thought leadership marketing is a discipline unto itself.


Thought leadership marketing is similar to PR in that it positions your thought leaders or brand as experts in your field. And, like content marketing, thought leadership marketing involves creating value for your target audience with engaging content.


A thought leadership campaign aims to engage your audience on a regular basis, and through multiple channels, to establish more meaningful relationships with prospects and customers.


**WHAT IS THOUGHT LEADERSHIP MARKETING?**

Thought leadership marketing positions your company as an authority in your industry.

People want to know and do business with people that see the big picture, are innovative, and know where the market and industry are headed.

A successful thought leadership marketing campaign will answer the big questions affecting your industry, while conveying these values to your prospects, so when the time comes to purchase a product or service like yours, you are the first company they think of.

**BENEFITS OF THOUGHT LEADERSHIP MARKETING**


* **Thought Leadership Proves Your Expertise**
> If you started a business, then you’re an expert at something, but you still need to prove it. A large collection of engaging thought leadership content will remove any shred of doubt, as you show time and time again that you understand your customers’ problems and how to fix them.

* **Thought Leadership Positions Your Brand as an Innovator**
> Before a business makes a major investment in your product or service, they want to know you can serve them now, and well into the future. As they grow, and the market evolves, a thought leadership position assures prospects that you’ll be able to keep up with them. Or better yet, inspire faster growth.

* **Thought Leadership Creates More PR Opportunities**
> Holding a thought leadership position makes you more desirable to journalists, bloggers, and other influencers, as your own influence and name recognition grows.

* **Thought Leadership Creates Greater Collaboration Opportunities**
> Influence is the currency thought leaders deal in. The more influence you carry, the bigger the names will be that come out of the woodwork and approach you to collaborate on content. This can snowball into a massive following in relatively short order.

* **With a Top Thought Leadership Position, Sales Come Naturally**
> If you’re able to sustain regular engagement of your audience with high quality content, you’ll eventually become the company everyone wants to work with. Even if they know little about what you have to offer, they do know and trust your thought leaders, and anything your thought leaders put their names on must be good. Through a sustained relationship, prospects come to adopt your values and way of doing things, and when it comes time to pick a solution, your solution “magically” checks all the boxes.

You really need to find a smooth balance with how aggressive or passive your campaign should be. I know from myself that I unsubscribe from email list immediately if I find them annoying just once. 

But, at the same time, you can reach much more sale if you keep hitting them with follow up offers or abandoned cart emails. 

Recently I was registering [Agent](https://agent.growthtools.com/signin), a site that can help you to be booked as a speaker around the world, but before finishing my registration I decided to go back. I don't know why, but I wasn't interested anyway. Now, I have received 3 emails in 6 days encouraging me to finish my registration and this has chased me even further away from registering. The first email was okay, but the second and third made me unsubscribe completely and I will probably not be a future member. 

This was just an example of how careful you should be with follow up emails since it is not only fact that a subscriber unsubscribes. They are also associating your business with an annoying feeling and this turned a semi-warm lead into a stone cold one. 

The reason why I use this as an example is that my impression of email marketing right now is that it gets even more aggressive and I don't that is the right way to go. You need to find the right balance because, of course, you should try to chase abandoned customers. 

My prediction for 2018 is that it becomes even more important to personalize your emails and segment your email list. By 2019 it is expected that there would 246 billion emails per day, so you should start to consider how you will stand out from the crowd.

**Industry:** Coffee Shop

**Elements:** 
* open later than most nearby coffee shops
* not very modern interior
* social channels little to no following or valuable posts to re use
* nearby college
* large inside areas and lots of tables

**Budget Allows:**
* In store content creation 1-2 hours a day
* In store device for creating content
* Gift cards of up to $150 of coffee a month

**Requirements:**
* You can only do 2 channels, this is to force you to list out which two channels you will target and why. 
* Give types of posts you will do and how they will benefit the short and long term goals.
* Worst case, leave a sentence / small tip or idea for a coffee shop in content marketing.

Have fun with it, this might suck. I might have left out info or made this too boring. Hoping we can boost some engagement get people to leave some quick fun ideas for a coffee shop content marketing.

I recently built a new community-based platform where digital marketers can showcase examples of the projects they create. It’s almost like a bit of a portfolio for digital marketers.

While I moderate the community, I’ve been collaborating with people in my network to help publish content. I’ve found that most digital marketers love sharing their experiences to build their personal brand, but just don’t have the time to sit down and write about it.

I found that ghost writing for these people has been effective. I start by sending through a list of 5 questions around a project or topic, then get the member to add some points or sentences.

Once they add this content, I draft it into a full post and let them make any final changes to suit their writing style.

This process has worked well so far, but I’ve been restricted to the size of my own network.

Just wanted to reach out and see if anyone would be interested in sharing their experience and collaborating on some content.

How to grow a newsletter,6,c80kco,https://www.reddit.com/r/content_marketing/comments/c80kco/how_to_grow_a_newsletter/,26,1562046065.0," 

Hey!

I have recently started a newsletter of marketing inspiration, sending out quick-to-read, brilliant advertising examples three mornings a week to spark creativity. I love fresh/innovative/unconventional advertising and I love newsletters but I'm yet to find a marketing one which is snappy, easy to read & without paywalls/redirects/articles... so I created one myself.

Initial response at work & outside has been really positive and I am now growing my subscribers through my network (offline and online - LinkedIn, Twitter). However I am also thinking at ways to make it grow faster / expand outside my contacts. Have you got any suggestions on how to grow a newsletter or newsletter-website (a bit like The Hustle)? Any tested methods?

I'd like to get as many people as possible on board to keep testing & optimizing the idea and create something really value-adding.

Thanks!",2019-07-02 00:41:05

Between Google's Medic update, the client's voice/style preferences, and the length of these articles, I'm having a hard time coming up with enough content to meet the agreed-upon wordcounts.

I'm here looking for suggestions on how to find additional content/sub-section ideas for these blogs. Basically, how do you guys flesh out your outlines so the end product provides meaningful information and isn't just padded fluff?

Right now my process is to look at the SERPs for our desired ranking keyword (an ingredient used in one or one of their products.) Then I do a "".gov"" and "".edu"" search and analyze those top SERPs. And then I do a site search of Quora and certain sub-Reddits to find additional questions people have on the keyword topic.

Those searches become my first attempts of fleshing out an outline's various sub-sections which I would then research and flesh out during the writing process.

The client has a holistic/woo-ey voice and they do not care for technical scientific explanations or quotes from other sources that do not match their voice or tone. (Read as ""technical/overly STEM-y explanations for how a given ingredient works in the body is probably too technical for their brand. They prefer talking about things like ""holistic lifestyles"" over ""how/why an ingredient can/can't improve one's metabolism."")

They do not want us to talk about an ingredient's ""benefit"" or related research unless the researchers are conducting experiments with human subjects. And, of course, they do not want us, to mention side effects or possible negative aspects of the ingredient.

With the above in mind, where else would you recommend I look for sub-sections/ways to beef up my content with something that isn't fluffy writing?

I don't want to give away more information about the client than I have to, but if additional information would help, I'll try my best to answer follow-up questions.",2019-01-07 20:09:49

How to Avoid Legal Entanglements in the Blogging World,7,7vemux,https://www.reddit.com/r/content_marketing/comments/7vemux/how_to_avoid_legal_entanglements_in_the_blogging/,1,1517864954.0,"Are you fond of blogging? Is it your life's passion and the very blood that runs in your veins? If yes to all the question, then you should know all the laws, intrigues, and infringements that surrounds this craft or you risk yourself running into an $8,000 fine for just using an image that has a copyright or even a statement or truth that is originally written by another author without proper reference.

As a blogger, whether you are just starting your career or already a veteran, taking precautions is important. An article I have read before talks about *[how a blogger can protect himself from any kind of lawsuit](https://www.process.st/legal-guide-for-bloggers/)* and overall tarnishing his or her good name in the blogging industry.

**Here is a short summary of that article**:

- Use public domains and fair use images for your articles. Images are an important aspect for Google to recognize your kickass piece and help you with your SEO and snagging the first image that you see in your search engine result is hugely tempting, but this can land you in trouble and disrespect the image owner if you just grab it and post it without any permission or acknowledgment. Filter your image search, better yet, go to Pixabay, Pexels, Wikimedia, and Creative Commons if you want to be surer. You can also buy snaps from Shutterstock or iStock.

- Create a disclosure statement on your website, especially when you are fond of creating paid reviews or a product has been given to you free in exchange for an honest review. This helps your credibility by becoming transparent to your readers. 

- Consider diverting some of your works to Creative Commons for more exposure. Your contents, if you know they are good, can be used for references and spread more awareness about you. If you are a writer, you can get hired to do an interview with your niche's influencers. If you are a songwriter/composer, some producers might come across your works and decide to give you a chance.",2018-02-05 15:09:14
How I Went From “Shitty” Writer to “Sort-Of-Decent” Writer in a Year,4,7v937z,https://www.reddit.com/r/content_marketing/comments/7v937z/how_i_went_from_shitty_writer_to_sortofdecent/,3,1517802842.0,"Last year, I decided that I wanted to learn content marketing. 

The only problem? 

I was an awful writer. Like, embarrassingly awful. My target readers avoided my content at all costs – which, from an outside perspective, made sense. Nobody likes to vomit. 

But somehow – through hard work or the grace of a transcendent power, I don’t know – I was able to improve. I went from a “nobody” writer to writing and managing the content strategy for a high-growth startup, all in one year’s time. 

Here’s how I did it : 

#1) I imitated (with caution).

Establishing a writing “style” is hard as f**k.

I know because I tried — and miserably failed — for five months to do it.

Embarrassingly, my struggles continued until I discovered a quote from William Zinsser in his book, *On Writing Well*, only two months ago:

>“Never hesitate to imitate another writer,” William wrote. “Imitation is part of the creative process for anyone learning an art or a craft. Bach and Picasso didn’t spring full-blown as Bach and Picasso; they needed models. This is especially true of writing.”

I can confidently say that my own style, whatever stage it may be in, has developed tremendously from following this advice, and I recommend it if you want to do the same.  

**But be careful.**

When I discovered that quote, I was also reading Ray Bradbury’s Fahrenheit 451, an absolute masterpiece of a novel. The combination of William’s advice and Ray’s brilliant style spawned an absurd idea in my head.  

>“What if I could copy Ray Bradbury’s style and develop my own from his influence? If I practiced every day, I think I could do it!”

Spoiler: I couldn’t.

Every time I wrote, I felt as if Ray’s ghost was standing behind me, whispering abuse in my ear:

>“You call those sentences? I could shit better sentences than that. Look at all those grammar errors and cliches… my god. You’re a disgrace.” 

I couldn’t even manage a single word. It was hellish.

So, if you choose to practice this, I have one piece of advice:

**Stay within reality’s boundaries.**

#2) I hired professional editors (but not often).

A few months ago, I hired Greg, a professional editor, to critique my writing. 

My plan for Greg was simple:

I had recently written an article that was due for publishing on the beyourself Medium page, and I wanted to impress their readers, so I hired him to kill the remaining errors in my piece before it went live.  

“I’m giving this guy such an easy time,” I thought. 

By that point, I had furiously self-edited the article and was confident that Greg wouldn’t spend more than a day fixing my tiny mistakes. And I was right.

He sent me his finished work the next morning.

**And when I opened it, I was blinded by a gang of red highlights.**

“No,” I thought. “This can’t be right.”

All those “polished” sentences and paragraphs, all those “elegant” metaphors I had scattered about the piece — Greg tore them apart, and he shattered my ego in the process.

But that was exactly what I needed.

Months of self-editing had conditioned me to overlook the stupid mistakes in my drafts. It was as if the “pronoun switches,” “fatty words,” and “logical errors” in my writing were camouflaged.

With the extra set of eyes that Greg provided, however, spotting (and fixing) them was easy. 

I haven’t worked with Greg since the last massacre — but I need to. The knowledge he gave me from one editing session has carried over to every article I’ve written since.

Thanks, Greg.

#3) I wrote *and edited* every day. 

“Writing every day” wasn’t new to me. I was ~~ ahead of the curve ~~ and had established that habit a few months before.

But something still felt…. missing.

Daily writing was great, but I wasn’t writing better words because of it. Rather, it was only helping me to overcome my fear of writing (think, exposure therapy). I wasn’t practicing “good writing” until I started editing.

>“Editing,” I thought. “That’s it.”

Editing was my process of turning shitty words into decent ones.

It was where I actually applied the skills I was learning, like “varying sentence length” and “cutting fat” and “creating transitions.” In the words of a cliched gym analogy…

**Editing was like exercising, while daily writing was like getting over the fear of judgment from other gym-goers.** 

They’re both necessary — but it didn’t make sense to only practice one or the other. So I started doing both.

Have you ever wondered how I’m able to consistently produce breathtakingly immaculate words with such grace and flutili… flul… fluidity?

That’s how.

...

The Power Of Content Marketing & Your Online Business,7,758xe4,https://www.reddit.com/r/content_marketing/comments/758xe4/the_power_of_content_marketing_your_online/,0,1507583242.0,"A new research by Conductor demonstrates the significance of content when it comes to influencing consumer purchase decisions, brand affinity and increasing sales. As per the survey data from Conductor, customers are 131 percent more likely to make a purchase if their journey down the sales funnel starts with educational content. The participants in the study were asked to select between four different brands to purchase from and 83.6 percent selected the brand that featured educational content.

The report includes 3 key findings:

Customers are 131% more likely to purchase from a brand, instantly after reading a piece of content.
65% of customers feel positive or trustworthy about a brand after reading a piece of educational content from that brand.
When it comes to decide between various brands, 83.6% of customers selected the brand that featured content
Certainly, all these stats are attention-grabbing enough. Content marketing has an influential impact on customers’ likelihood to buy. Content, in particular educational content has an influential and positive impact on customer’s feelings about that brand. It helps increase trust and brand affinity radically.  All above findings powerfully support and highlight the significance of today’s customer-centric marketing.

Brand-building is not at all about making money. Rather it is about establishing a connection and relationship. Prospects who read educational content begin to view that brand as a reliable resource and it can be a good start to establish a bond. Content marketing arms customers to know, like, recognise and trust a brand.

All in all, including and sharing different types of content like FAQs, product reviews, product comparisons, use cases, instruction manuals, repair/maintenance tips, user guides, expert interviews, white papers, webinars, etc. can prove to be useful to establish your brand and increase sales.",2017-10-09 16:07:22

Thing is, I just saw that someone was paying ~150 bucks for a 3000 word article which I though was really good! Also, there are a lot more article options there now than 5 years ago.

To be able to write those articles you have to write at least 40 articles and have an average of 4.1 stars in reviews, which I don't think it's hard to achieve. I only have 19 articles written and I have 5/5, and for a 17 years old non native English speaker I think it's pretty good.

This used to happen to me every time I published a post, and that's why I stopped updating this site for a 5 year period.

That is, until I re-educated myself and learned how to truly promote my blog and its content.

So now, whenever I slave away on an article, I know my jobs not done.

Once my article is published, I need to promote the hell out of it to ensure it gets shares, backlinks, and all the other good stuff that comes with running a successful blog.

I've put together a proven list of the steps I take, and the steps experts take to promote their blog every time they publish a new post.

How important is content in a digital marketing strategy?,6,4iun8p,https://www.reddit.com/r/content_marketing/comments/4iun8p/how_important_is_content_in_a_digital_marketing/,4,1462998216.0,"You have already met this statement many time, but let’s repeat it: content is king. And it is a king everywhere, including digital marketing field.
A proper digital marketing strategy consists of a variety of issues where content is the basis that will (or will not) lure a potential customer.



Today, you cannot just write your benefits or compare your business with others. People want something new. A good example is AirBnb, whose digital marketing strategy was based on one’s uniqueness.

You should start your content strategy from social networks. Use Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Pinterest. Before creating accounts, decide what, where, when and how you will post because this is what will attract your target audience. You can do it manually or use editorial calendars and other services to ease your work. Pay attention to the following editorial calendars:

CoSchedule - WordPress editorial calendar

Kapost - if you have a big team, this editorial calendar is for you

PromoRepublic - an editorial calendar with a template library (includes a bunch of custom templates and post ideas, graphic editor, and special occasions notifier)

Gather Content - minimalistic editorial calendar for WordPress, Droopal, and Expression

EngineDivvyHQ - good content calendar for big teams

All this services include post scheduling function, which will save you tons of time.
Do not post casual things. Your content should be exciting, unique, and memorable if you want your reader to come back to you again. Furthermore, coordinate your content with the latest trends. Remember: never look around, stick to your strategy, be interesting, useful, and you will achieve your goal.",2016-05-11 15:23:36

Questions for freelancers (or not) that use Linux,5,bsulot,https://www.reddit.com/r/content_marketing/comments/bsulot/questions_for_freelancers_or_not_that_use_linux/,7,1558820352.0,"Hi,

I hope this post is okay here; otherwise, I apologize.

If you’re a Linux user, whether you use it exclusively or not, I hope you'll chime in. I'm looking for how it affects your work life in particular.

**(TL;DR)** My questions:

As far as being a Linux user is concerned:

1. What issues have you had with clients (huge or otherwise)?
2. What other OS, if any, do you use and what do you use it for?
3. What platform/format do you usually use in submitting your work? (e.g., MS Word, .docx, LibreOffice Writer, .odt, Google Docs, pdf maybe, etc.?)
4. Do you find yourself always “negotiating” with clients about the little things like, say, formatting?
5. (Probably  off-topic) Would you consider it a red flag if a client doesn't consider your requests for using Linux stuff? (e.g., a .docx saved in LibreOffice Writer)
6. What topics do you write about?
7. Other tips are welcome. Thank you.

\---

(Not the TL;DR)

I decided to shift to Linux (kind of) 6 weeks ago. To make the long  story  short, I bought a brand new laptop with pre-installed Windows 10  while  hoping I could have it ""downgraded"" to Win 8.1. I don't like Win  10. But  Win 8.1 wouldn’t work with the new hardware anymore, as  explained by  the local vendor, and as confirmed on Microsoft's website.

I wiped Win 10 and installed a Linux OS.

I also have a 4.5 year-old Windows 8.1 desktop.

I like Linux. Actually I’m not sure whether I love it already. This is   coming from a forever Windows user, and from someone that wants   everything ""out of the box"" and likes the GUI (Graphical User   Interface)...pretty much the experience that Windows provides.

Now I want to dive deeper into freelance writing/copywriting but, like I said, I don't know how being an exclusive Linux user affects one’s work   life/livelihood...

... because I want to get rid of my old Win 8.1 already, and replace it with Linux, too.

I’ve  been in the Linux subs and it seems that not a lot of freelance writers (especially those that do not write about code or maths or other similar sorts of technical writing) use Linux as their main OS. So here I am.

Thank you for reading, TIA.",2019-05-25 16:39:12

I’m a senior in college (on my last semester!) and I’ve been feeling the pressure lately to start applying to jobs.

Essentially, everyone thinks their content is the greatest and that makes the role very tricky. Also, there is no content calendar and no distribution mechanism. Nothing is data backed. He said that within the next 6-12 months, they want to connect content marketing with SQLs and that the role is more about setting up a structure first and then getting these people to buy-in to your calendar and then driving it to start generating a tangible impact on the business, if not direct leads. 

I worked in marketing for close to 7 years before taking a break. I'm now getting back to it and while I'm confident that I can drive the functional side of it, I'm a little concerned about the people side of it, especially considering that I would have no influence in the initial months. What advice would you give me to become successful at a role like this? I see plenty of challenges but lots of opportunity as well. ",2018-12-13 17:58:10

Here's why it's okay that content marketing does not provide an immediate ROI,5,9n600g,https://www.reddit.com/r/content_marketing/comments/9n600g/heres_why_its_okay_that_content_marketing_does/,1,1539253816.0,"Most businesses know how important inbound/content marketing is.

So if content marketing is an incredibly strong lead generator then why do we give it the least of our attention, if any?

It’s not because we’re lazy, ignorant, or afraid. It’s much simpler...

**Business owners put their time, effort, and energy into the areas where they can see more immediate signs of life.**

In the heat of the moment, or at 4:30 pm on a Friday afternoon, it’s easy to skip the blog for another week, to promise yourself you’ll  hammer out a strategy Monday, or that you’ll start some discussions to get something off the ground.

But these are all stall tactics.

Unfortunately, the “long-term” feels too far away so many business owners never take those first steps without being guaranteed immediate ROI or even just knowing when they can expect *some* content marketing ROI.

## Immediate ROI vs. Compound ROI

**Compound ROI** is not immediate ROI. You might not see any traction on  your blog after the first month or two or even three of publishing.

But then you start getting a few hits.

Then a few subscribers to your newsletter.

Then you make your first sale, and the prospect says to you “yeah, my  colleague forwarded one of your blog posts to me,” and before you know  it, your sales team goes from just you to an inbound content sales team  of dozens. Hundreds.

It’s a snowball effect. That’s how **compound ROI** works.

We’re not saying you should give up on outbound marketing. For most small businesses, including PostPilot, it’s a lifeline.

What we’re saying is you can walk and chew gum at the same time.

Here’s the deal…

If there’s one thing I want you to take away from this blog post, one way I can encourage you, it’s this:

Content marketing is not an immediate ROI and that's okay.

More so than strategy, more so than distribution—this is so often what creates the ceiling on a blog’s growth. When the writers are also the practitioners, your content immediately stands out.

Intercom's senior editor Geoffrey Keating explains how he facilitates this:

- Get buy-in from the top down. When the company leaders are interested in blogging, it trickles down.
- Make it dead simple for writers. Geoffery doesn't beat up people's writing in a Google Doc. Instead, he schedules meetings to chat face-to-face.
- Use the blog hiring. The more diverse the writers on your blog, the better it is for hiring. This also creates the expectation that new hires will have the opportunity to write as well.

Making it look nice and presentable is also stress-free using blog themes that are so simple to install and customize.  But to say that you have a well-maintained WordPress blog requires more than just a pretty theme. To boost your blog’s potential, you need to learn [how to write a blog post](https://easyblogthemes.com/how-to-write-a-blog-post/) that sells and gets a lot of reads. What also matters is a steady stream of quality content that must be published on a regular basis.

If you are constantly on the lookout for the latest blogging tips on creating high-quality content, then you are on the right path. Committing on the quest to have the best content for your blog is probably the best thing that you can do to make your blog stay afloat and on top of other blogs.

You have probably read hundreds of blogging tips by now and is quite boggled at the flood of information. To help out and keep you sane, here are 10 of the most effective, simple, and attainable tips that you really need.

Tip #1. Always strive for original content.

Truth be told, the internet has a multitude of information that are repeated on thousands of sites. Do not fall into thinking of making it easy by rehashing ideas or asking permissions to repost. The surest way to stand out is to differ and offer unique material that your target audience is looking for. It will pay off once the audience sees the effort you’ve placed on creating one-of-a-kind quality content and will come back for more.

Tip #2.  Research on topics that interest the readers.

It is important that machine readers be considered when creating high- quality content. However, what matters more is whether the posts are “shareable” enough when readers found them. Trending topics and those that are relevant to a certain group of people will most likely get multiple shares thereby escalating your blog in the rankings.

Tip #3. Practice writing STRONG headlines.

The title is the first thing that the readers see on a post. It should be convincing at a glance in order to make them read the whole article. Lose their interest at the first 8 seconds they spend on reading the headline and you lose the chance of having their time. Check out this very useful guide on how to make compelling headlines.

Tip #4. Be accurate.

Be accurate means being able to protect your reputation by providing solid information that is not only relevant but, more importantly, true. Feeding the public with false info can be damaging to you as the author and to the company that you represent. How much the readers trust your posts is reflected on the number of links directed towards your article. This means that they find your posts true and helpful enough that they get shared among their circle.

Tip #5. Supplement with visual materials.

High- quality content is not limited to informative articles. There are people who prefer visual information like pictures and videos. To be on the safe side, supplement your posts with pictures or, if needed, videos. Just make sure that such media are highly relevant to the content. Yes they make the article look aesthetically pleasing but the primary reason why they are placed along with the text is to support the claims made within the post.

Tip #6. Be concise.

Longer blog posts do not necessarily mean they are better. In fact, the lengthier the content is, the higher the chance that the reader loses interest over it. The key to having a brief but informative content for your blog is to remove the fluff. Get straight to the point and do not be bothered with counting words.  Eliminate unnecessary details and focus on the topic so that the interest stays from the start until the end of the article.

Tip #7. Use a conversational tone.

Most of the readers look for posts that are easy to read and are relatable. So don’t expect their preference if you keep on using technical terms or an overly business-like language. Unless your blog caters to a corporate audience, most web readers will choose to read an article with an informal tone because they are less boring and are not too complicated to comprehend.

Tip #8. Eliminate time pressure by writing ahead of schedule.

A blog stays relevant and interesting if it can regularly offer new posts. This is why you should make a schedule of when you will write and post new content. Spend time to list down future topics and make it a habit to allot time for research. Avoid rushing as you write for the risk of producing low-quality outputs. It would be nice to have some time to review the content thoroughly before finally posting it. This will give you ample time to check and revise mistakes. In the end, you are sure about your written piece and will be confident to present it to your audience.

Tip #9. Grammar and spelling check please.

Even if it has been agreed to use an informal tone to your posts, it is not an excuse to forgo grammar and spelling errors. The web audience may want an easy read but it does not mean that you give them poorly written articles with lots of grammatical and spelling blunders.

Tip #10. Edit thoroughly.

Finally, the most important among all other blogging tips, is to edit your piece thoroughly. Thoroughly means checking every single detail of the article; from the headline down to the parting words, the format, grammar, spelling, links, sources, pictures and other media, among others. There should be time allocated only for editing content and make sure to put your best effort to edit your posts well. Do not settle for just a round of editing. Edit it until not when you are finally satisfied with it but only when you can really say that the audience will love it.

There you have it. These surefire blogging tips will make a huge difference on the way you post content for your blog.

Full disclosure, this article does focus on one tool because it comes from the blog of the tool, but I still think it's really useful to read. I don't work for Airtable, but we use it at the content marketing startup I work at, so it was really cool to read this article and find the parallels that this other company is using it for in their content team. 

In posting this, I am mainly curious about how others manage their content pipeline and what the biggest pain points people have in their editorial process.

This article tackles a couple pain points and offers their solutions. First it focuses on how you can:

1. ""Identify gaps in the existing content.
2. Come up with creative angles that hook readers while providing practical advice.""

The tool in discussion allows you to create views for your entire pipeline, or just the pipelines for certain blogs, or customers if you are a content marketing company like mine. 

Another problem we often face is juggling the 20-50 articles that we are currently working on at any time. This article offers a solution to that problem as well. 

Lastly, this post tackles the issue of automation, which has saved us countless hours at my startup (we also use Zapier).

Has anyone else out there tried Airtable for content management? We used to use Trello, and I am just blown away by how much more you can do with Airtable.

Streamlining Your Content Creation Ideas,4,6n8ogy,https://www.reddit.com/r/content_marketing/comments/6n8ogy/streamlining_your_content_creation_ideas/,0,1500063722.0,"Inspiration is one fickle mistress, this much I can attest to as somebody who writes for a living. I have hit a ton of bedrock more often than I wanted to admit and encountered writer’s block even though I cannot afford to. 

Writing is my bread and butter, but writing for a living is not a rose-colored moment all the time. There are instances when you are at the end of your rope and ideas refuse to come out no matter how much you want them to. 

Creative block is a scary situation, but it is not something that you cannot work around with. Yes, it is a helpless situation, but with enough determination, the right set of habits, and the right processes in place, you can still go on writing and get out of the rut you are stuck on, even though your inspiration is failing. 

An article I have stumbled upon a few days back talks about how you can *[organize and automate](https://blog.rankwatch.com/organize-automate-content-ideas/)* your content ideas to help you with your content creation efforts.

*Here is a brief summary of that article if you do not have the time the whole of it*:

**Generating new ideas**:

- Listen to podcasts whenever you are aimlessly passing the time. Podcasting is a great way of learning and soaking up knowledge even when you are trying to be idle or cannot muster the energy to read. You can also listen even though you are doing something else such as house chores or exercising.

- Pick up a book on something you want an in-depth learning. Aside from reading blogs and long-form articles, diving into a book solely dedicated to the subject matter you are interested in is one of the best ways of thoroughly learning and exploring every nooks and cranny of a topic. Picking up a book on different matters every now and then can really help you generate ideas that can figure out big time in your next content.

- Follow your favorite bloggers by setting up an RSS feed. Reading and observing your favorite writers through their pieces is a good way of discovering new tips that you can incorporate into your own writing style. Find out what is it about the way they write that makes you consume their contents. Likewise, observing those less popular bloggers and their contents will also give you an idea what to avoid when writing.

- Take a break and simply use the time to take a short walk. Doing something menial can help you a lot in generating ideas. There are times when creative ideas pop when you are doing something as insignificant as walking or doing dishes.

**How you can organize the ideas that come to you**:

- Always have a ready access to your Evernote. Whenever you come up with something you think will be a great idea for your next piece, immediately jot them down in your Evernote. We can be notoriously forgetful and have a hard time recalling ideas. So, instead of losing them or wracking your brains out in a desperate attempt to remember them, just write them down for safekeeping in your Evernote.

- Using Zapier, an automation tool, hook your Evernote to Trello, a project management app, to automatically generate an idea board that you can later sort out for writing.

- Set a schedule to sort through all those ideas you have jotted down. Weed out those gibberishes not worth pursuing and arrange in an organized manner those that are worth writing.

- Once your ideas are properly organized, you can now pen them in on your content calendar and finally sit down to write.

Organizing and automating your content creation process can go a long way of helping you through your writer’s block. If you have another great idea on how to better generate ideas for content creation, kindly share them with me.",2017-07-14 15:22:02

Secrets Of Becoming An Amazing Content Writer,5,65t5wl,https://www.reddit.com/r/content_marketing/comments/65t5wl/secrets_of_becoming_an_amazing_content_writer/,4,1492427012.0,"Creating a great piece of content that becomes popular among the readers tops the wishlist of every content writer. In spite of that, why does most of them miss the target? Have you ever wondered why one piece of content gets more engagement from the readers than another one that is written on the same topic?

The answer lies in the differences in the approach of each content writer and in the way they create the content.

So, if you plan to become a content writer, then remember that:

Every piece of content that you create must be interesting and relevant, and the topic should resonate in the minds of the readers. Otherwise, they will soon lose interest.
No two pieces of content will have the same appeal even if their subject matter is same.
Most of the times, there are hundreds of existing content on the topic that you are writing on. So you need to be very creative in order to make your content stand out from the crowd.
The Preparation

In order to create an engaging content, ask yourself these questions before you actually start writing.

1. Who will read your content?

Are all the websites that you visit have the same appeal? Some look very simple with popping colors and designs, while others have an extremely professional look. The reason behind the difference is that these websites might be trying to reach out to two entirely different groups of people.

Similarly, while writing a piece of content you need to have a clear idea of who your audience is. This will determine the style, tone, and language of your content.

For example, if you are writing a blog for the general public, write in simple language that everyone can understand. On the other hand, if you are writing an academic paper, you may use jargon and technical language, since the audience is niche, and technically oriented.

2. Which topic will interest them?

Suppose you are going somewhere and you need to be directed to reach your destination. You ask a person for directions, but instead, he tells you where you would find the best pizza in the city. He did help you, but not in the way you wanted it.

Same goes for your content creation. Unless you satisfy a query of that the reader has, the content will not be read.

A golden rule of content writing is to create content that provides information on a popular topic or solves a problem that many people are facing. Otherwise, it is is less likely to engage a lot of readers.
Steps To Be Followed By Every Content Writer

1. Research

A thorough research is crucial every time you create a content. This step is probably more crucial than writing the content itself.

Through research, you can gather in-depth knowledge about how the problem or query of the readers can be addressed. It will also help you to understand how your competitors/peers are addressing the same topic.

You have to also ensure that whatever content you write is unique. To ensure this, the content writer needs to find out what has already been created by others. This is an indispensable part of content creation that helps your content to stand out in the crowd of related pieces of content. It will also enable you to avoid creating duplicate or redundant content.

2. Decide on the structure of the content
Once you form a clear picture who your audience is, and how their query is already being addressed by others, you need to build a rough structure for your content. This will come in very handy while writing a content, and can ensure that you do not deviate from the main topic.

To further avoid the chances of deviating,

Break up the content in different sections with the help of sub headers,
Use bullet lists, numbering, etc. to make the main points easily understandable.
3. Write the content

After all the research and framework comes the actual work of writing the content. A content usually has four parts. all of which have to remain inter-related.

The title of your content either makes or breaks it. If the title is catchy and attracts the reader’s attention, then it is most likely to be read and shared. To make your title attract a lot of readers, go through this blog by HubSpot.

The first paragraph:

The introductory paragraph needs to be made as interesting as the title. This is where the readers anticipate how much value you are going to provide to them throughout your entire content. Try to touch the key points of your content in the introduction itself. If that is not feasible, then show sincere urge to provide the necessary information to them in the introduction and guide them to the body where you actually provide satisfaction to their query.

The body:

The body of your content is where you put in all of the information. Make sure to make it scannable, so that the reader can form an idea  about what information the article will provide. Include pictures, charts, and tables, use formatting to highlight parts of your texts, use numbering and bullets to break the monotony of plain texts.

The conclusion:

In the conclusion, highlight the main topics of your content in a nutshell and encourage the readers to comment and share the content.

Also, if your content has a lot of information to deliver, then make sure that it does not become monotonous, otherwise the readers will lose interest in no time.

3. Edit thoroughly

As soon as you finish writing the content, you need to thoroughly edit what you have written. In the process of content creation, there is absolutely no room for spelling or grammatical error. To eliminate the chances of such error, you could use online grammar checking tools like Grammarly, Ginger or any other reliable tool that is widely available online. Before your content goes online, make sure it has no error.

So now that you know the recipe for creating an informative and engaging content, let us recapitulate our purpose of content creation once again. We do not write for ourselves. Yes, you may love writing what you wish to convey, but in the case of content creation, you have to keep in mind what your readers want. When you deliver engaging pieces of content that your readers find valuable, they enter into a zone of trust. When this happens, the readers eagerly wait for you to publish your next blog. So, with humanistic and personal approach make your audience embark on a long-term relationship with you.",2017-04-17 06:03:32
How To Build A Content Marketing Machine,6,651bi7,https://www.reddit.com/r/content_marketing/comments/651bi7/how_to_build_a_content_marketing_machine/,0,1492062987.0,"While most agencies focus on creating quality content for their clients, many of them don't use those same strategies for themselves. I've worked for several agencies where we produced amazing content for our clients but left our own content on the back burner, putting it off for when things slow down. 

Simon Thompson of Content Kite saw the problem and decided to build a solution, he shares how to build a content marketing machine for your agency. He simplifies the content creation process by using what he calls the hub and spoke model. First, you come up with a central idea to base your content around, for example, a digital agency advising their readers on how to better their business through technology.

Once you have that central idea, you create spokes from it: ideas that spring naturally from the central idea. For example, the digital agency might write an article about the advantages of a mobile-friendly site versus a separate mobile app.

Once your content is created, it's time to promote it. Listen to Simon's tips on how to amplify your content and how to use content upgrades to create leads. http://blog.hubstaff.com/simon-thompson-on-building-a-content-marketing-machine/

So a quick summary: 

While not working full-time as an Adwords advertiser, I also intern with a company that helps further the careers of artists and musicians. Essentially we help our clients by giving them the tools they need to succeed (access to press, networking capabilities, other artists to collab with, social media, etc). 

I've been brought on in order to work with our paid/sponsored content in order to grow our YouTube page. Currently, we have so much content but no real strategy as to how to get it in front of people. The YouTube page is pretty filled up too in terms of content, but they're just videos that haven't been revisited since the first upload & publishing of them. The most advertising these content pieces got were a couple of social media posts on Instagram: after that - nothing. 

So really...What do I do with all of this content? I was thinking of funneling bigger content pieces and uploading those series to Facebook & sponsoring videos based on the content in them, but then that doesn't help grow our YouTube efforts. 

There are basic things I found that I can do to our current content pieces such as optimize the tags and descriptions, but I'm really lost as to what I should do in terms of racking up views & building a healthy Youtube ecosystem. 

Any suggestions? Also thanks everyone in advance. ",2017-02-22 20:34:41

**2. Clickbait Headlines / Titles**: Everybody knows about it, and nearly everybody hates it. If what's on your headline is nowhere in the actual content, then forget it. It will only drive people away.

**3. Nothing but self-promotion**: Why bother writing an article that only praises and advertises yourself? What value does that bring to your readers? It's supposed to be a blog with useful content, not an echo chamber.

A Method You Can Use To Come Up With Actually Useful Content Ideas (x-post entrepreneur),5,5fmoy0,https://www.reddit.com/r/content_marketing/comments/5fmoy0/a_method_you_can_use_to_come_up_with_actually/,2,1480497788.0,"Just thought I'd share a way to come up with content ideas that are highly desired by people in your niche.

**TL;DR:** Find a topic related to your niche on Quora (the hugely popular Q&A site). Look for questions that have a high amount of views but few answers. This means that people want the answer (badly), but very few are capable of trying to answer it. If you can answer the question really well, it'll be easy to get attention (You could even put a link to your blog post on the original Quora thread to start driving traffic).

---------------------------------------------
My motivation for this is that I hate working on things that have been done. I want to find new problems to solve that are actually useful as well. This is the latest method I have thought of to come up with ideas.

Key thing to remember: Most great content from a marketing perspective is not only well written (or coded), but it solves a problem that hasn't been solved a thousand times before. No, we don't need another fucking list of your SEO tools (to just about every SEO blogger these days).

This method involves using Quora, a Q&A site.

The idea is simple:

* Find questions that tons of people have visited (shown interest) - Quora shows you these stats
* Of those questions, find the ones with very few answers
 
These questions are 1 of 2 things:

1. Stupid questions - People can't be bothered to answer them because they're not coherent
1. Problems of interest - People really want the answer to the question, but can't find it

Obviously we want the second.

--------------------------------------------
**An example:** 

Say I wanted to write for entrepreneurs. I go to Quora, login, and type in ""entrepreneur"" in the search bar. A bunch of ""topic"" suggestions come up.

I decide to pick the ""[Startup-Founders-and-Entrepreneurs](https://www.quora.com/topic/Startup-Founders-and-Entrepreneurs)"" topic. If you append ""/all_questions"" to the end of a topic URL, you get exactly that - all the questions.


Then, click on a question, and you'll see the number of answers, along with the view stats in the right sidebar. Go through a ton of questions and find the most desired/least answered ones.

*Important note:* It would suck to do this manually.

I scraped 2000 questions as an example, and filtered out the worst ones. **Here is a link to the result spreadsheet:**

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Z6I8cQxn40GKLyeEGUdyaCj4vPzMCPSc9hM3elTUzrc/edit?usp=sharing

Where:

- ""Question"" is the question posed on the page
- ""Answers"" is the number of answers (any with 0 have been counted as 1)
- ""Views"" is the number of views
- ""Views to answer ratio"" is the number of views divided by the number of answers (high is good)

Of the top results, very few are ""stupid"" questions, most are intriguing.

Now, you just may not be able to answer some questions, but there are some ""hard questions"" that definitely *can be answered well* if you're willing to put in the effort. If you are able to in a post/video/whatever, it's going to be genuinely useful and easier to promote than other content.

In that time I've worked with a few local advertising agencies on the production side of things mostly in commercial spots and web videos. 

Where I live (Omaha, Nebraska) there's only a handful of agencies and there are definitely a lot of people better than me at the top levels, so I take what I can get working low-mid budget jobs with the ad companies, and crew on shoots - usually as a Camera Op or 1st AC (assistant to the camera operator). 

At any rate, where I see a major white space is in helping local businesses with their content marketing. A lot of them have little or no presence on the web and I definitely have the skills to make some great content for them, the problem is I have no skills or experience in pitching this kind of work. Most of the agency work I have found myself in is through a recommendation from other production crew folks who I've gotten to know. 

Currently, I'm reaching into my network to find opportunities to ""practice"" so to speak for friends who have a business but have no content. It's giving me a chance to build a demo reel and example projects so I'm not pitching theories but actual finished results and hopefully build out my network. However I know this is a slow burn process and I'm eager to find ways to accelerate it through work.

So my question to you fine folks here is - If you were starting an agency focused on helping clients create and manage kick-ass content, what would your 3-6 month strategy be? Spec work until you're off the ground? Cold Calling? Ad-Words/Facebook Ads? Some kind of free class where I teach people the basics of content marketing and hopefully maybe convert some customers from that? ",2016-11-08 09:59:30

How to Become a Content Superhero,5,3n09cn,https://www.reddit.com/r/content_marketing/comments/3n09cn/how_to_become_a_content_superhero/,0,1443670724.0,"“The will is everything. If you make yourself more than just a man, if you devote yourself to an ideal, you become something else entirely. Are you ready to begin?” – Batman Begins

I wasn’t raised on superhero comics, but I was raised on content. Commercials between Saturday morning cartoons and ads on bus stops were always interesting to me. Now, as digital content is taking the world by storm, I find it hard to see through the darkness of poor content to find what’s worth paying attention to. I’m sure many of you have noticed the same thing.

The bloggers, vloggers, and social media ‘gurus’ of today are a very different society of influencers compared to what many of us were exposed to only a few years ago. But there is still hope beyond posting a filtered picture of the sandwich you’re having for lunch… There are still content heroes amongst us! And you can become one. You don’t even need to get bitten by a radioactive spider.

Be the content provider that the world needs, and the one it deserves. Follow this 11 step guide to becoming a content superhero.

**1) ""The only source of knowledge is experience"" – Albert Einstein**

Write what you know. It’s been said before by many, but I’ll reiterate its importance. Writing about something that you aren’t a confident expert in will reduce your credibility with a potential audience. Support your content with your work, schooling, or passions. There are plenty of armchair quarterbacks in the world, but only a select few who have had the privilege to play professional football. People would rather listen to the person with experience than the critic.

If you were a busy IT worker with a passion for music, you might be inclined to create a headphone based vlog. You have the tech expertise, and you’re writing about a specific passion that you are able to connect to reality. Find your version of this and run with it!

**2) ""Make them an offer they can't refuse"" – The Godfather**

Channel your inner Godfather here. Always have a reason behind what you create and always have a value proposition. Let the content speak for itself and make that speech very persuasive. If someone doesn’t feel compelled to read or share your content, they won’t.

You may be selling your services, your advice, a product, or your soul, but whatever you do, make sure the audience knows you aren’t just producing content for the sake of producing content. It may work great for cat videos, but not if you’re trying to have your content taken seriously or if you’re recommending a specific call-to-action.

**3) Greed is NOT good (sorry Gordon Gekko fans)**

No one has to pay attention to your content, that’s their choice. People skip advertisements for a reason and they don’t want to be subjected to ad abuse within the content they choose to follow. [Millennials](http://innetwork.net/2015/08/millennials-marketers-need-know/) are especially privy to the thinly veiled marketing attempts behind certain content. Don’t pander to them. Don’t oversell your products. Don’t ask for shares in every paragraph of your text. If you sell a product, do it at a fair price. Be human so they can continue to relate to you and love your work!

**4) What's black and white and red all over?**

In the current world of content, black and white is never re(a)d all over. Please use colours. And not just for the sake of it. There is meaning behind colours and many of the world’s most successful businesses follow this when designing logos and a brand image. Keeping on the topic of branding, be consistent. Once you choose your colours, stick to them and try to incorporate them [consistently across all your social platforms](http://innetwork.net/2015/06/9-ways-become-ideal-influencer-marketers/). Consistency leads to recognition and recognition leads to trust. By establishing this trust with consumers, they are more likely to revisit your content in the future.

If you’re having difficulty finding one colour to stick to, use the [Google Colour Palette](https://www.google.com/design/spec/style/color.html) for inspiration. The colours work well together, they’re easy on the eyes, and if they’re good enough for Google, then who are the rest of us to disagree?

In addition to using colours, use images and infographics to grab the attention of your audience. Written content is taking a backseat to videos and imagery. A post with an image or infographic is [94 percent](http://www.skyword.com/contentstandard/enterprise-marketing/skyword-study-add-images-to-improve-content-performance/) more likely to be read than one without. If you want your message to be read, then you need to find a way to keep the reader intrigued beyond just the quality of the text.

**5) ""Blank space baby"" – Taylor Swift**

Yes, you need colour, but I said colour, not clutter. Equally, if not more important than colour choice, is leaving blank spaces in your images, writing, and on your website. If content is crowded by its surroundings, it doesn’t stand out. [Reader Mode](http://www.cnet.com/how-to/how-to-enable-reader-mode-in-chrome/) was created for reasons like this, but don’t force your audience to rely on it or you won’t have an audience to worry about for very long. [Millennials have some of the shortest attention spans](http://innetwork.net/2015/08/millennials-marketers-need-know/) of any generation. Don’t expect them to stick around if they get distracted by what’s in the margins.

**6) An apple a day... Isn't good enough anymore**

If you blog once a day, great. If you engage once a day, then that’s no longer good enough. Be the poster-child for content. Post pictures, vlogs, Vines, and links. Tweet and Retweet. Do anything you can to remain relevant in the eyes of your audience. With that said, don’t smother them.

Mix things up to see where you received most of your traffic. You might love taking pictures, but have three times the Twitter followers than you do on Instagram… Find a way to play to your strengths, and tweet those pics! Once you’ve established a few successful social accounts, you can focus more of your energy on those. The point is to avoid limiting yourself early on and to embrace new opportunities to share.

**7) Master the art of keeping up with tomorrow**

Did you hear about this cool new iPhone 4!? Of course you did, it came out five years ago… Did you hear about the iPhone 6s? Maybe, but maybe not, as it hasn’t been announced yet. Most people assume that the iPhone 6s will be Apple’s next big device, but the anticipation of the moderately unknown is what grabs the readers’ attention.

People want to be ahead of the curve and feel like they have an insider’s scoop. Help them stay one step ahead, with logical predictions in your area of expertise. There’s a reason rumour websites are so plentiful and successful. The model works. Remember Step 1 though, if you consistently get information wrong or seem completely lost, you might as well retire from the world of content superheroes.

**8) ""Lost time is never found again"" – Benjamin Franklin**

Be productive. Don’t start a social account and then get back to things two months later once you feel like it again. If you want to turn your content into something more than a hobby, you must commit to the work.

You aren’t going to be living off of your instagram account, or at least not right away. So you must ensure that you have the time to treat your content as an important part of life, but not the only part. Unless you know something I don’t, no one has more than 24 hours in a day, and even the busiest of people are able to organize if they prioritize.

**9) ""There is no one alive who is youer than you"" – Dr. Seuss**

You may be the king (or queen) of retweets, but unless you’re always the one breaking the news, your audience can easily turn elsewhere to receive updates. An audience follows a person, not a concept. The topic is just there to show directions. Coming up with innovative ideas to stay ahead of your competition is difficult, but it’s what distinguishes you as an original, thought-leading influencer!

I’m not funny. I never have been, and don’t expect to suddenly wake up and be able to do stand-up. I am witty though, and I know that it makes my writing informal enough to seem relatable and clever enough that you know I’m not a complete hack. If you aren’t funny, that’s fine, but find a way to be distinctive in your particular area of influence. Find a way to stay fresh and real. Relating to your family, talking about your coworkers (with their permission of course), or going slightly off topic to give a birthday shout-out to your significant other, is enough to remind people of your humanity.

**10) ""If you take shortcuts, you get cut short"" – Gary Busey**

Did Charlie bite your finger? Did you see a double-rainbow? If so, you’ve stumbled into [viral](http://innetwork.net/2015/08/4-proven-approaches-effective-viral-marketing/) fame and need a plan to make it last longer than 15 minutes.

If you’re like the rest of us, and aren’t as lucky, don’t expect to find these shortcuts. Remember [Balloon Boy](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/events/balloon-boy)? The hoax of a six year old getting trapped in a hot air balloon went viral, but for all the wrong reasons. Like cheating on a test, taking a shortcut can never equal what studying could’ve solved. Good content will rise to the top over time if you put in the effort, but only if you put in the effort. Expecting instant success will give you the same result as instant coffee. You’ll be left bitter, annoyed, and probably wishing you just took the time to brew a pot or make tea.

It’s common practice for people to purchase social media followers so that they can seem like they are a credible thought leader. Don’t do this. It’s easily detectable and many programs can test your followers to determine the percentage that’s fake. If you want more followers, start to follow other influencers and build up a basis of strong content. Remember, “if you build it, they will come.”

**11) With great content, comes great responsibility**

On a final note, you owe it to yourself to share your skill-set with the world. If you want to be considered a thought leader in a particular field, you are responsible to make it happen for yourself.

If you get writer’s block or if you don’t seem to get shared as frequently as you feel your work deserves, don’t give up. Share your own content, connect on Linkedin, and ensure the people who care to know, can find out. We live in a big world, but the internet has helped it become a whole lot smaller.

**Hulk Smash**

Considering that I told you to be original, but managed to write an entire blog riddled with pop-culture references, you must take what you’ve learned with a grain of salt. No one has perfect content and people can sometimes find success using unorthodox methods. However you choose to approach your content, make sure to harness your skills for good, not evil. Channel your inner superhero and become the content smash you were destined to be.

"[Case Study] Using Reddit To Acquire 7,239 New Users (and 47,611 Visitors) With $0 In Ad Spend In Just Under 10 Hours. Here’s How!",3,epf9f1,https://www.reddit.com/r/content_marketing/comments/epf9f1/case_study_using_reddit_to_acquire_7239_new_users/,1,1579183371.0,"Facebook, Instagram, Google, Youtube -- all of these have one thing in common. The costs to advertise on these platforms just seem to keep going up.

With big names entering the digital marketing scene in droves, it’s no longer easy for the small start ups, solopreneurs, and marketers on shoestring budgets to ef fectively campaign and show ROI to investors and employers.

This was an issue we faced at [Rezi](https://www.rezi.io/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=post&utm_content=casestudy), more specifically the issue I (the marketer) faced.

*(Shameless plug): Rezi is a SaaS company that offers job seekers an alternative to building resumes. Instead of the pretty, glamorous templates you see on most resume generators (which actually lower your chances of getting interviewed), you get access to simple, standardized resume templates that pass Applicant Tracking Systems - the hiring algorithm companies use to organize and track candidates.*

Ok. Let’s get back into it.

Where were we.. that’s right advertising costs and the feeling of dread stemming from a failure of profitable marketing.

Here are some stats from Rezi’s ad account on Facebook:

* Cost per free trial at the top of funnel: $5.45 to $11.65
* Cost per free trial at the middle of funnel: $3.92 to $4.26
* Cost per lead at the top of funnel (free ebook): $16.55 (WTF?)
* Conversion rate of free to paid = 0.9%
* **TLDR; We were projected to spend $600 for one customer.**

Here’s the math $6 (cost per free trial) \* 100 (the number of sign-ups we need for a paying subscriber).

All for a $9/mo product (LTV ≈ $37). **Uh oh.**

Being the incredible marketer I am, I decided to go to Google.

A little cheaper, but not by much.

Well eff that.Let’s target Pakistan..... just kidding.

***Brainstorm time***: if we have a referral program, then we can add some virality to it right?

Sure, there was an issue though. Like most startups, Rezi was understaffed. Meaning, there was only one person that can implement a project like that, and he was busy working on the app. Shit.

With no one to turn to and out of options, it was time to commit ritual suicide.

But then there was a knock on the door. It was Reddit.

The founder, being a huge fan of Reddit and active on the boards, posted an AMA titled “When I graduated college, I had interviews at Google, Dropbox, Goldman Sachs, and others because of my resume, despite a 2.2 GPA. Now we've built a software to make the same resume for free. AMA!”

Jackpot.

One person came in from Reddit, then 10, then a hundred.. until:

[https://preview.redd.it/gciembucywa41.png?width=2232&format=png&auto=webp&s=cddf8309c807a6c15079c48eddbb939b1ce2fee8](https://preview.redd.it/gciembucywa41.png?width=2232&format=png&auto=webp&s=cddf8309c807a6c15079c48eddbb939b1ce2fee8)

500 users were on the site at any given time. From the United States, Canada, UK, even Dubai, you name it.

[https://preview.redd.it/7mohawieywa41.png?width=2232&format=png&auto=webp&s=dfd9b87fe533e089b9c7ff3be006a51ab6c3e8fa](https://preview.redd.it/7mohawieywa41.png?width=2232&format=png&auto=webp&s=dfd9b87fe533e089b9c7ff3be006a51ab6c3e8fa)

And suddenly the issue of acquiring users wasn't so much of a problem.

[https://preview.redd.it/meufbn4gywa41.png?width=2232&format=png&auto=webp&s=8be53077b99d20c7df2b4c158fc586d41e858fe8](https://preview.redd.it/meufbn4gywa41.png?width=2232&format=png&auto=webp&s=8be53077b99d20c7df2b4c158fc586d41e858fe8)

Brand recognition helped with search engines as well. As people began to search for Rezi on Google, big G began to take notice and Rezi’s rank began to go up as well:

[https://preview.redd.it/8ts2jpsiywa41.png?width=1552&format=png&auto=webp&s=536d7052278d558e38e2c2582d311a98f7676b31](https://preview.redd.it/8ts2jpsiywa41.png?width=1552&format=png&auto=webp&s=536d7052278d558e38e2c2582d311a98f7676b31)The days of 10 web search clicks per day were over, now it was time for 100 web clicks per day.

But the question still remains. **What drove people to click? Is it replicable? And if so, what’s the formula?**

First up, **the headline**.

In Shane Snow’s book, titled “Smartcuts”, he tells the story of Upworthy, then a fairly unknown new and media site, which eventually experienced viral growth in 2013.

Largely known for click-bait titles, almost to a fault, Upworthy was also a master of experimentation. Now dubbed the 25 Headline Upworthy challenge, the small news company would use a/b testing to see some of its article titles perform 165% better than others of the same article.

Their headlines would often hit on an emotional level, pulling heartstrings to generate clicks.

Of course that wasn’t the intent with our Reddit post title, but there was naturally a bit of a shock value:

Today Google receives over 3 million applications per year. To hear back from Google, well a near impossibility. But how was it that the founder was able to get a callback from Google, Goldman, and Dropbox… all with a 2.2 GPA?

Everyone wants to know.

Next is **story**.

Call it Star Wars, Harry Potter, even The Shining, you’ll always see the same recipe: story.

Here’s how the story brand framework (by Donald Miller) works:

There’s a hero, with a problem, who meets a guide, that gives them a plan, with a call to action, which results in success (or failure avoided).

Here we have the hero: people who are looking to write resumes (in case you forgot Rezi is a resume software) to land a job (some with horrible GPAs, myself included), who meets a guide (the founder), who gives them a plan and an action step (Rezi) which results in a 100% pass rate for hiring bots.

The story is there, and it’s a good one at that.

**Trust**

It’s the best way to build a relationship, without it we’re all just strangers. Case and point: Facebook - once the privacy issues started coming up, Facebook users became more and more wary of the product. In the eyes of the people, Mark Zuckerberg was just another evil mogul.

Here’s how Rezi built trust with the community, and how you can too. It all comes down to engaging with the community and sharing core values:

[https://preview.redd.it/q4i52cukywa41.png?width=2232&format=png&auto=webp&s=e2f32f7ec1dc91ffc5e4f0ffb4d4dc0f307bc3fa](https://preview.redd.it/q4i52cukywa41.png?width=2232&format=png&auto=webp&s=e2f32f7ec1dc91ffc5e4f0ffb4d4dc0f307bc3fa)

**Viral coefficient**

There were two factors that contributed to this AMAs virality.

And one of them goes back to the trust mentioned earlier.

A while back, Rezi actually had another post on Reddit. It was the resume writing subreddit and found some traction there. Until one day, after one post to many, Rezi was banned. For life.

But Rezi picked itself up, and it soldiered on - learning from past mistakes - this time, it wasn’t going to happen again.

So before posting, the founder would reach out to the moderators of the AMA subreddit and ask their permission prior. Which the moderator appreciated.

When the post went live, it was a slow day in the subreddit. With no interesting posts in sight, the moderator decided to do the unthinkable. He gave his new friend.. a badge. Almost immediately, the post received more attention.

Now unbeknownst to the moderators, there was a certain trick up the sleeves. We knew the post would garner interest if people were able to see it. But how was the question.

It was through….. (\*whispers\*) the purchase of 50 upvotes. Yes, it may have been a bit of cheating, and maybe it wasn’t totally free. But 50 upvotes leading to 31.2K upvotes is money little and well spent.

**Bonus Level: Timing**

Every January, interest in resumes picks up. New year, new me? NO. New year, new resume. This interest picks up until November 18, at which point, interest plummets.

[https://preview.redd.it/g8uunromywa41.png?width=1532&format=png&auto=webp&s=e8322b7ec5b9cbd31beb2277dbdd4afdab90dc36](https://preview.redd.it/g8uunromywa41.png?width=1532&format=png&auto=webp&s=e8322b7ec5b9cbd31beb2277dbdd4afdab90dc36)

Having gone out on November 14th, Rezi would make it just in time to take advantage of the dwindling, yet existing interest. Always keep timing and customer interest in mind.

So what can we learn from all this? Simply put, Facebook, Instagram, Google, and Youtube can go fu--

Breathe.

There’s a platform for each business model and as marketers, it’s our job to figure it out.. and at the heart of it all is experimentation. Even if you fail once, twice, thrice, keep digging and one day a diamond might turn up. For us it was Reddit (and now you know how we did it), for others it may very well be Facebook ads, or influencers, or affiliates, and the list goes on. Any failure is just a beginning to success (as long as you keep experimenting).

Now before I end this on a corny note, I wanted to ask you, what are some innovative ways that you generated traffic? What were your results on Facebook/IG and Google/Youtube like?
