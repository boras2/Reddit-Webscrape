Pinterest needs to be removed from Google IMO,62111,85atho,https://www.reddit.com/r/google/comments/85atho/pinterest_needs_to_be_removed_from_google_imo/,1547,1521403326.0,"Hi Googlers

I'm searching for a specific piece of technical hardware and I get 100k results from Pinterest. Everyone of these results requires a signup and log into Pinterest to be able to see it.

This is not in accordance with Google's rules, as those are not open results.  Basically Google is working as a Pinterest expansion tool.

Pinterest needs to be removed from Google IMO. They clutter the images results and do not allow users to obtain what they search for.

Just 2 cents about that. Thanks.",2018-03-18 15:02:06

"New Google Docs phishing scam, almost undetectable",12454,692cr4,https://www.reddit.com/r/google/comments/692cr4/new_google_docs_phishing_scam_almost_undetectable/,1090,1493866443.0,"#The scam should now be resolved, good job on the speedy resolution Google!#

## Official statement:

> We realize people are concerned about their Google accounts, and we’re now able to give a fuller explanation after further investigation. We have taken action to protect users against an email spam campaign impersonating Google Docs, which affected fewer than 0.1 percent of Gmail users. We protected users from this attack through a combination of automatic and manual actions, including removing the fake pages and applications, and pushing updates through Safe Browsing, Gmail, and other anti-abuse systems. We were able to stop the campaign within approximately one hour. While contact information was accessed and used by the campaign, our investigations show that no other data was exposed. There’s no further action users need to take regarding this event; users who want to review third party apps connected to their account can visit [Google Security Checkup](https://myaccount.google.com/secureaccount). *([source](https://thenextweb.com/security/2017/05/03/massive-google-docs-phishing-attack-currently-sweeping-internet/))*

I received a phishing email today, and very nearly fell for it. I'll go through the steps here:

1. I [received an email](https://i.imgur.com/3NRq1yD.png) that a Google Doc had been shared with me. Looked reasonably legit, and I recognized the sender.
2. The [button's URL](https://i.imgur.com/r56QsM9.png) was somewhat suspicious, but still reasonably Google based.
3. I then got taken to [a *real* Google account selection screen](https://i.imgur.com/HNt0yMa.png). It already knew about my 4 accounts, so it's really signing me into Google.
4. Upon selecting an account, no password was needed, I just needed to [allow ""Google Docs"" to access my account](https://i.imgur.com/JGvHa4H.png).
5. If I click ""Google Docs"", it shows me it's *actually* published by [a random gmail account](https://i.imgur.com/tf02z1R.png), so that user would receive full access to my emails (and could presumably therefore perform password resets etc).
6. Shortly afterwards I received [a followup real email from my contact] (https://i.imgur.com/DGSyy1L.png), informing me: ""Delete this is a spam email that spreads to your contacts.""

To summarise, this spam email:

* Uses the existing Google login system
* Uses the name ""Google Docs""
* Is only detectable as fake if you happen to click ""Google Docs"" whilst granting permission
* Replicates itself by sending itself to all your contacts
* Bypasses any 2 factor authentication / login alerts
* Will send scam emails to everyone you have ever emailed

Google are [investigating this](https://www.reddit.com/r/google/comments/692cr4/new_google_docs_phishing_scam_almost_undetectable/dh36pv2/) as we speak.

#FAQ

## How do I know if I've been affected?

If you clicked ""Allow"", you've been hit. If you didn't click the link, closed the tab first, or pressed deny, you're okay! The app may have removed itself from your account, and may have deleted the sent emails.

## What do I do if I've been affected?

1. [Revoke access to ""Google Docs""](https://myaccount.google.com/permissions) immediately. It may now have a name ending in `apps.googleusercontent.com` since Google removed it. The real one doesn't need access.
2. Try and see if your account has sent any spam emails, and send a followup email linking to this post / with your own advice if so.
3. Inform whoever sent you the email about the spam emails, and that their account is compromised.

## What are the effects?

All emails have been accessed, and the spam forwarded to all of your contacts. This means they could have all been extracted for reading later. Additionally, password reset emails could have been sent for other services using the infected email address.

[This](https://pastebin.com/EKdKamFq) *may* be the payload, so it *may* just self replicate, and not do anything nastier. This is not at all confirmed, however, so assume the worst until an official Google statement.

## I'm a G Suite sysadmin, what do I do?

*The following steps [by/u/banden](https://www.reddit.com/r/google/comments/692cr4/new_google_docs_phishing_scam_almost_undetectable/dh37uz3/) may help, but I can't verify they'll prevent it.*

1. Block messages containing the hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh@mailinator.com address from inbound and outbound mail gateway/spamav service.

2. Locate Accounts in Google Admin console and revoke access to Google Doc app. It may now have a name ending in `apps.googleusercontent.com` since Google removed it.

I used it for a solid 3 months after using GPM for about 3 months. I heard they were planning on canning GPM so I figured I might as well bite the bullet and switch. Here are my main takeaways.

1: YTM is incomplete. There are albums on GPM that aren't on YTM. To rub this in further, the ads for YTM say ""it's all here"". It ain't. I know that there are holes in both services but in my experience, YTM is incomplete.

2: YTM is buggy. There was a bug I encountered where I couldn't access my downloads without a connection sometimes. Idk why. It may be a bug on my end, but still, I had no bugs with GPM.

3: Finally, the biggest con. YTM is straight up confusing. It's less intuitive to use. Why isn't there a song or genre tab in my library. Also GPM library tabs give previews of the contents of the tab as you can see in this pic

https://m.imgur.com/gallery/COwoew7 (sorry I made it on my phone.)

Also I NEVER use the hotlist tab in YTM. I just want my library. Not to mention the fact that subscribing to artists in YTM turns your regular YT feed into a flaming garbage blob.

There are only 2 things I like about YTM over GPM. First is the dark theme. Dark theme good. Second the offline mixtapes are cool. I've found a couple of good artists through it.

So Google, please don't pull the plug on GPM when the alternative you'll force us to use is incomplete, buggy and confusing. We'll switch to spotify. YT music isn't just not good, it's kinda bad.",2018-12-26 10:04:39

There was a man's voice saying he was calling on behalf of Google Maps. He told me he was Google's Assistant trying to accurately update our work hours for Christmas day. It took me a second to process what he had just said because A) it sounded like I was just talking to a regular person, and B) I was trying to put what he just said into context, while simultaneously looking for my work schedule lol. 

I told him at first ""I believe we're closed Christmas day?"" He responds with ""Mhmm, ok, so you're telling me that you are closed on Christmas day, correct?"" I reply with ""I believe so, correct."" Then he thanked me for my time and wished me a great day!

Someone like me, who watched Google's presentation a couple years ago for Duplex, could tell (barely) where certain inflections were being output by a robot lol. But if I hadn't seen Google's Duplex presentation, and I wasn't listening for those telltale signs, I would've never guessed that was Google's Assistant AI calling me. So yeah, that was pretty rad lol!",2019-12-09 21:54:41
