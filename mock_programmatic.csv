Agency Bashing,19,elebl9,https://www.reddit.com/r/programmatic/comments/elebl9/agency_bashing/,21,1578445674.0,"Hey Guys, just trying to understand why the language around agency managed programmatic is so negative.  A post today sparked this when someone said ""we let the agency handle programmatic for too long"".  I cannot understand how everyone thinks in-housing is the solution to end all solutions.  I know how much work agencies put into programmatic education and management (I get it not all agencies). I know what the learning curve is like.  I see the uneducated (I get it, everyone is learning) questions posted here from people probably managing thousand of dollars and making simple errors.  It's so disheartening to see how people view the work being done and I am trying to understand why it's like that.",2020-01-07 19:07:54
"This Ad Fraud Scheme Stole Millions, But Almost No One In The Advertising Industry Wants To Own Up To It",18,9uryq8,https://www.reddit.com/r/programmatic/comments/9uryq8/this_ad_fraud_scheme_stole_millions_but_almost_no/,1,1541564336.0,"***Summary:*** *A  couple weeks ago, BuzzFeed published an in-depth investigation into an  ad frame scheme affecting more than 125 Android apps and websites. The  scheme apparently stole many millions of dollars by mimicking human  behavior to evade detection. Most exchanges are refusing to divulge  actual financial losses associated with this specific scheme. -R*

""A  massive ad fraud scheme that Google acknowledged stole close to $10  million from its ad networks and partners has been shut down after  BuzzFeed News revealed its existence last week. But as of today, more  than 30 companies that unwittingly helped the fraudsters earn money  won’t comment on how many fraudulent ads they sold, or said the amount  is small or nonexistent.""

""The  fraud operation exposed by BuzzFeed News last week involved more than  125 Android apps and websites that tracked real human users and used  this data to program bots to mimic their behavior as a way to evade  fraud detection systems.""

***Note:*** *It's  worth noting that mobile apps are a perfect breeding ground for ad  fraud, for a number of reasons. First, it's generally more difficult to  implement ad verification in mobile app environments. Second, when it  comes to issues like spoofing, there is currently no solution like  ads.txt for mobile apps (although* [*a spec is in the works*](http://t.dripemail2.com/c/eyJhY2NvdW50X2lkIjoiNDM5NDMyNCIsImRlbGl2ZXJ5X2lkIjoiNDE5ODc4OTEwMSIsInVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vaWFidGVjaGxhYi5jb20vd3AtY29udGVudC91cGxvYWRzLzIwMTgvMDYvSUFCLVRlY2gtTGFiLU1vYmlsZS1hcHAtc29sdXRpb24tZm9yLWFkcy50eHQtRHJhZnQtZm9yLXB1YmxpYy1jb21tZW50Xy1GSU5BTDYuNC5wZGY_X19zPWI0bXBydHl4aTV6Zm5wazZwY2cxIn0) *\[PDF\]).  But ads.txt only addresses spoofing and unauthorized reselling. The  nature and sophistication of the ad fraud scheme in this story would  have been outside the scope of a solution like ads.txt. And lastly, with  ad budgets moving to mobile, it's also a lucrative target for  fraudsters. -R*

""BuzzFeed News  contacted 36 companies that carried ad inventory for the affected apps  and sites or otherwise helped them monetize at some point. Almost none  shared specifics about how much money was stolen via their platforms, or  whether they will be issuing refunds. Ultimately, the money was stolen  from the brands and other companies who bought ads on the affected  websites or in apps.""

""Experts say this  lack of transparency is endemic in the digital ad industry, which has a  large and growing fraud problem that sees criminals steal billions of  dollars a year from advertisers. Many brands now grudgingly accept that a  certain amount of the money they spend on digital will be lost to  fraud.""

Essentially, Index is saving the particular bids from specific advertisers, on specific DSPs, and then re-using them in future auctions for that particular User ID.  They have tried to conflate this with ad caching, which occurs irrespective of the particular auction, and is simply used to reduce load times.

What does the industry think about this?  I'd like to get a DSPer's take on this and why they haven't blown the whistle.  There is no way this would hold up technical scrutiny from a DSP, therefore they are complicit or ignorant.  I am not sure which is worse.",2018-08-17 23:48:53

Think about...
- Features you use the most
- Features you never use but think are cool
- Or features you've heard of, but don't quite understand (but you think they're cool)

It seems like many marketers use DMPs for completely different use cases, set them up differently, etc. so I'm curious to hear some other experiences about how people have used them. 

I'll start us off. In Audience Center (Google's DMP), you can easily build audiences based on any ad exposure that you serve through DCM (so you have to be using DCM as an ad server, obviously). So if I do a reserve buy or P.G. homepage takeover with NY Times, I can build an audience of people exposed to that ad, and retarget them (you have to get their permission obviously). You can extrapolate this to quite a few different creative applications and I always thought it was really cool.

I don't have experience with Taboola, and we're currently using 99% TTD, so I'm hoping you guys with more experience can help me sleuth through this one.  


I get his monthly reports, and Taboola is quoting an average CPC of $0.17 - $0.25; which in my view this is a major red flag. What's more, his GA is reporting an average cost per session as $.33, and an average of 1.6 pages viewed.  


How is Taboola getting this performance? I have a suspicion that they're secretly running in-app display behind every native campaign. I know they have an automatic - 1200x627 creative generator that crawls the URL for images and resizes accordingly. Might they be doing the same for 320x50s and buying garbage inventory to decrease their CPC?  


What about the cost per session?  


Or does Taboola have exclusive inventory, and is TTD picking up the scraps? Our CPC is down to $1.05 after several rounds of optimizations; nothing close to $.17.

Advice on Programmatic B2B w/ Niche Audience Targeting,8,av55z6,https://www.reddit.com/r/programmatic/comments/av55z6/advice_on_programmatic_b2b_w_niche_audience/,18,1551247091.0,"Hi everyone.  Looking for insight on programmatic.  I work at a material science company, in a niche but growing part of the industry, nanomaterials.  We have found that advertising has not done much for us in the past.  While we are not certain, we have attributed this to not being able to target audiences down to a workable level.  

For example, we specifically need to reach research scientists / development scientists / process engineers / program managers / product managers mostly at Fortune 500 and 1000 companies in the US and EU.  Ideally, we would reach people that have previously expressed a behavior around interest in nanomaterials (e.g. – visit our website, visit specific nano websites, read journal articles on nanomaterials, etc) .  

So the first question, is this level of targeting possible with programmatic and all the systems that support it?

The other question is more fundamental.  My basic understanding of programmatic is that publishers provide inventory that are sold on exchanges or privately.  Do you find niche publishers are adopting programmatic approaches?  The types of publishers we would be most interested in placing content with are likely in the 25K to 100K users per month range.  There are not a ton of them.  Some examples would be Chemical & Engineering News or Chemistry World.

Really appreciate any insights you can provide.  The concept around programmatic capability is exciting, but difficult to understand from the outside what is possible or not.

Currently I have compiled a list based on advertiser and agency reports and have sent ""cold proposals"" to these companies/agencies/desks through ADX.

So, I am building this internal deck to explain programmatic planning to people who may have done their stuff in digital, but are definitely not traders, so I want to include some detail into what happens under the hood.

Now, like many of us, I learned about this when Header Bidding did not exist and 1st price was just something you could not check. I recall the idea of ""price buckets"", I believe it was Appnexus that showed avails on different price ranges. That gave us some idea, considering a waterfall model, that better inventory came at larger prices as a rule of thumb.

But, now we have HB and 1st party auction, yet prices in the open market continue to be very low and there are places where simply it appears there isn't a bottom of the barrel. DV360 in particular, and thanks to their unique access to ADX, pushes the price down a lot.

As a fresh graduate in NYC, programmatic assoc. strategist salaries ranged from 35k to 38k agency side at an agency that I considered an extremely capable player in Programmatic. (multiple awards + cannes lions)

Second year employees saw a bump to high forties/low fifties.

I assumed that was standard for the industry, but I then obtained interviews for one year of experience positions at other agencies touting offers of \~$60K+

I ultimately decided against remaining in NYC, and I'm in talks with several Pub side companies over programmatic roles in San Francisco (1 year of experience). However, the nature of titles in our industry makes finding reliable salary info difficult. An ""account manager"" can be a 0-2 year experience position, or a 5-6 year experience position depending on the companies titling decisions.

To date, I have never been able to get DV360 to perform on par with Google Adwords or native Facebook Advertising (note, I buy paid search and FB/IG direct through the native platforms) across a number of conversion-focused campaigns.   


Everything I've read on this topic in this subreddit as well as r/adops generally says that DV360 is a superior, superior tool and that if you can't get it to perform properly it's probably your fault and not the platform's.   


I'm currently running a campaign designed to drive mobile app installs. When buying through Google Adwords (Universal App Campaigns) and native Facebook I'm spending around $8 per app install. In DV360 however I have yet to drive a single post-click install.   


While it's possible that DV360 is driving installs and there's something wrong with the tracking I find that unlikely. I've integrated DV360 with a CM account that's integrated with a well-built Firebase account so everything is pretty cut and dry here. Not only that, my DV360 campaign has registered three piddly view-through installs which suggests to me the tracking is not broken.   


I originally started my IOs set to ""Automatically optimize your bid and budget allocation"", but after talking to my third-party DV360 service provider, changed it to ""Set bid and budget at the line item level"" with a fixed $8 CPM bid (Google Universal App Campaigns spend around $6 CPM so this didn't seem unreasonable).   


I have run every conceivable cut of data looking for irregularities that would reveal a gaping wound in my setup where budget would be hemorrhaging. I pulled impression/click/CTR data by App/URL, Creative, Device, Browser, Make, Model, Geo, Exchange, Category, Inventory Source, Region, DMA....you name it (although not all at once). I do have relatively stringent pre-bid DoubleVerify restrictions (DV360 integrated) in place, and I have implemented post-bid monitoring via DoubleVerify also.   


It is certainly possible that this latest in DV360 performance shortcomings is just part and parcel of DV360 and that it's not actually capable of performing on par with Google Adwords and native Facebook Advertising at driving conversions. But it seems much more likely I'm an idiot who either has a gaping wound in his campaign (which feels improbable given the level of auditing I put in) *or* I just don't know how to pull levers to make a DV360 campaign perform the way it's supposed to perform.

Looking for input from DSPs or other publishers about preparing for Google’s 1st price auction,7,b9v4pq,https://www.reddit.com/r/programmatic/comments/b9v4pq/looking_for_input_from_dsps_or_other_publishers/,6,1554519331.0,"I work on open auction operations at a large publisher and we are currently working with our data science team to devise a flooring strategy for when Google fully switches to a first price auction. Currently (in a 2nd price world), our strategy has been to floor pretty granularly.

From what we understand, Google’s 1st price auction rollout plan will be 1% of total traffic for 30 days in May, then 5% for another 30 days, and then 100%.

There are a couple ways we think DSPs could respond:

1. **DSPs wait to shift their bidding algorithms until after the 100% roll out.** In this case, publishers will benefit from higher 2nd price auction bid prices in the short run, before prices level out.
2. **DSPs already have 1st price auction algos & bid shading solutions ready & will implement them on the 1% and 5% of traffic right away.** In this case, we assume DSPs will bid at existing 1st price auction levels (e.g. in EBDA, etc)
3. **DSPs will treat the Google landscape differently and test out 1st price auction algos on the 1% and 5% traffic, using that data to guide their behavior at 100%.** In this case, we think DSPs will start bidding as low as possible.

On the publisher side, we’ve been toying with a few different ideas, assuming we will be able to differentiate first vs second price auctions from Google log-level data:

* **Assuming #2 or #3:** We could use the initial 60-day window to set “higher” floors and train DSPs to bid higher than bargain basement prices (almost use it as a DSP training ground). We’re wary of flooring too high as anything below the floor is lost revenue.
* We’re curious how much of a price-taker we are: if we set floors going into this while no other pub does, will that DSPs will just stop buying from us. @DSPs is this even a possibility?

A lot of boring legalese, but then it gets into a detailed description of ""how they did it"":

(My comments are in ***bold***)

""To evade fraud detection....they ***(criminals)*** developed programming code designed to check and record whether the IP address and other identifying characteristics of a particular bot had already been flagged ***(add to blacklist)*** by cybersecurity companies as associated with digital advertising fraud. Over the course of approximately four months, they employed the code to vet ***(they blocked using any IPs/bots that were listed on the blacklist)*** more than 9.7 million IP addresses worldwide, including more than 4 million in the United States and more than 8,300 in the Eastern District of New York.  OYNYANNIKOV cautioned others not to direct traffic from bots that had already been flagged ***(add to blacklist)*** by cybersecurity companies to SSPs that were relying on those cybersecurity companies.""

&#x200B;

For those not paying attention in the back...

\#1 not one of the current ad tech vendors can prevent ad fraud. 

\#2 they use machine learning after you buy an ad and then send you a blacklist as a ""prebid solution"".

\#3 the criminals have access to the same blacklist you are using as your ""prebid solution"". 

\#4 no one is stopping ad fraud

&#x200B;

Here is a link to the indictment for your reading pleasure... please let me know if you come to a different conclusion after reading.

Currently I work in a German Company as Online Marketing Manager. Before I was a Media Consultant. In the media agency I've worked before we never used GDN but DBM for display campaigns. The reason was: It's more sophisticated, we have more possibilities (dynamic ads, better reporting and so on) and that's why it's better performing. To be honest: The CPC was always quite high, not to mention the Cost per Visitor and the Click Through Rate was low (average was about  0.2%).

Now, in my new company we work with GDN and DBM... and to be honest I was shocked: GDN performs way better by any means, the setup is much easier and we don't have any initial costs (CTR% is around 1%, CPC around a Dollar).

How is this possible? Are we doing something essential wrong with DBM? What are your Experiences: Is DBM just an over complicated, so-called sophisticated Tool without any additional value or did you develop DBM-Stragetgies that easily beat GDNs performance? 

Thanks for your answers, I really appreciate!

From my experience in digital marketing, programmatic has one of the biggest learning curves of all the channels.

My solution has been to setup a site where a user can:

1. Complete courses on a range of topics (e.g. basics of programmatic, private deals, campaign setup, and more) 

2. After the user watches a video lesson on the topic they have a short quiz. 

3. After each course topic you can print or share a certificate that shows completion (I'm actually in the process of getting accredited) each certificate has a unique ID # for that individual and course

4. In addition to the courses there is a downloads page with sample strategy ppt, sample plans, launch checklist, and other tools which can be useful for anyone starting out. 

5. Each month a new course on a topic will be added. 

I'm putting the finishing touches on the site as we speak but I would like 10 beta users to run through and do some usability testing in order to get some feedback. 

For reference the site is https://programmaticacademy.com

As a token of my appreciation, beta users will get free access for a full month.  

Please message me directly to be considered for this. 

What do I have to do as a beta user? 

1. Go through the process of signing up -take a screen shot and make a note about anything confusing.

2. Go through at least 1 course - take a screen shot and make a note about anything confusing.

3. Submit any other suggestions that come to mind.

While it's great in the short term, (always sold that there will be ""more time"" to do the important work of strategy and tactical thinking) it's hard to imagine a future where the entire buy isn't automated. Just feed a DSP your plan's parameters and watch it go to work.

Maximizing softer skills to (hopefully) get to a leadership position prior to sweeping automation or going (back) to school for a data science emphasis to assist in the automating seem like decent ideas, but I'm wondering if anyone else has put significant thought into this yet, or if it's more of a ""worry about it when it seems more imminent"", type of approach (not a fan of the latter, obviously--but feel like we probably have a bit of time here.)

Am I the only one who is having to make this workaround in DV360?,5,d065fv,https://www.reddit.com/r/programmatic/comments/d065fv/am_i_the_only_one_who_is_having_to_make_this/,10,1567743314.0,"My company acts as an agency, buying media for advertisers using DV360. We like to create and provide dashboards for our clients so they can see the performance of their campaigns. Our clients love the dashboards since they don't seem to get the same thing with other agencies. 

**Setup**

We use DataStudio for the reporting dashboards that we give clients. Clients love that the dashboard is updated every day so they can see their campaign performance ""live"". We originally thought it would be super easy to get this data back to clients since there is a built in connector for DV360. However, it turns out that connector is very, very limited. Basic metrics and reporting. We like to give our clients a lot more. 

Then we heard about File Transfer 2.0. Still, this did not have the dimensions and metrics we were looking to provide our clients . 

So we decided that we were going to extract and house the data ourselves to ensure we get the fields we are looking for. To o this, we utilize Google Cloud Console to create an API that calls a report from DV360, stores that report in Storage, cleaned and prepped with Data Prep, and then sent to BigQuery. Then we would connect BigQuery to DataStudio, and problem solved! Sort of...

**The problem**

Every day DV360 generates a report with all of the metrics and dimensions that we want, for all of our advertisers data from the day before. The API we created calls this report, goes through our process (stated above), and then updates a master table in BigQuery. 

The other day I was informed by Google that yesterdays data in DV360 is not viable/accurate. Best practice is to go back 48-72 hours. I asked a separate Google rep just to be sure since I thought that was odd. Sure enough, they said 48-72 hours. Since DV360 doesn't allow us to create scheduled reports for several days back, we are forced to look at other options. We want the report to update every 24 hours. 

So now we are currently working on a solution for a rolling 7 days worth of data. This would replace the data every 7 days, ""updating"" the dashboard to be accurate. 

I am not sure if this is the best workaround, but my word, what a pain. I am shocked that the DV360 connectors to DataStudio are so limited. All of the other platforms (Google Ads, SA360, GA, etc.) all have tons of dimensions and metrics. 

I have been asking around and looking for anyone else who is running into something similar, or at least feeling the pain we feel. Are we the only ones?",2019-09-05 23:15:14

We have an agency handle our programmatic. I just got a report that didn't sit right with and started digging. What are your thoughts? Please note, we are a 40 year old business with a ton of brand equity. Our owner is out there and somewhat famous. In our little neck of the woods when you decide to shop for the widgets we sell, you are for sure going to check us out and the other 3 stores. The idea that the programmatic campaign is solely responsible for getting people into the store is insane. With that said, if we really are serving ads to in-market people and they are actually behaving differently and coming to the store that's great and could easily justify the cost. It is just really hard for me to believe that, in our little market, people are being sent ads, and are then convinced to come to our store (slowly). Those with experience with programmatic geo fencing (or anyone for that matter) feel free to chime in!

Traffic from Adwords for the period: 15% New users, Bounce 2.28%, Pages/Session 9.24, Avg Session 2:26, Conversions 1%

We want to test a couple programmatic platforms to see if there is a benefit to our clients. We do a lot of awareness/general branding campaigns so tracking conversions isn’t important for most of our campaigns. We look at CPC, CPM and viewability to measure performance. 
We currently use DoubleClick Campaign Manager and I was about to sign up for Doubleclick’s Full Stack (includes Bid Manager, Search and Studio) until I found out that the agreement prohibits any type of casino and lottery advertising and since those are two business categories that we work with often, I’m now looking at other platforms. I’ve reached out to several but so far have just received automated emails in response.
I have a couple questions that I’ve had no luck finding answers to: 
•	Considering the above info about not tracking conversions, is there still a big benefit to going to programmatic as opposed to sticking with adwords? Our clients include casinos, lotteries, restaurants, events and credit unions.
•	Does anyone know how much reach is increased by switching from adwords to a programmatic platform? I understand that adwords uses just one network and a platform would provide access to many more, but what does that actually mean in terms of people? Are there really that many people (in USA) that aren’t being reached through the Google Display Network?
•	Do other programmatic platforms offer search? I don’t want one that is dedicated solely to search but would rather have one that includes search as an option. 
•	Same question for YouTube. 
•	What about the server? Will I need to switch servers to use another programmatic platform?

How does an SSP work from a technical standpoint in the trade?,5,69n6v7,https://www.reddit.com/r/programmatic/comments/69n6v7/how_does_an_ssp_work_from_a_technical_standpoint/,4,1494129415.0,"I am currently an assistant media planner for digital for the past 2.5 months and currently trying to understand the technical aspect of SSPs. 

I understand that the role of an SSP in programmatic is to sell inventory on behalf of a publisher via an exchange (open or private) to a DSP buying inventory on behalf of an advertiser for a specific audience group. 

Therefore, what is the technical process of using an SSP from the perspectives of a publisher?:
Does it have Targeting capabilities like setting up a Facebook campaign (where you want to target specific people to serve them an ad based on demographic and interest info, only instead you're telling the SSP to sell inventory to a DSP on the exchange that is in the market to buy it to serve an add to a particular audience) or does the SSP extract data from an analytics program like Google Analytics on behalf of a publisher (in this case a website) and the exchange automatically matches the data from the analytics program to the specific audience information that the DSP requests to the exchange.

We only do it regularly for one customer so I guess we do about 10-25 hours a month.

&#x200B;

I find CM to be a pain, mostly because you have so many repeating actions. I imagine for our use case it could be done in about a third of the time with more streamlined ad creation.

&#x200B;

I find DV360 lacking in the automation/optimization department. I find that most bid types have drawbacks - Wasted spend and training time are the major ones. There are so many things that have to be segmented into LIs if I want to have a decent amount of control - But it's a major timesink, both in setup and in in-flight optimization.

&#x200B;

Let's not get started on the reporting, the only serious analysis you can do is by exporting the data and analyzing it in excel/BI tools.

&#x200B;

Both CM and DV360 have APIs, and I could probably setup some scripts and exports and build something that would solve my pain points and automate segmenting/testing - but I can't be assed.

&#x200B;

So, over to my question. Is there a more powerful platform? Are there third party tools built on top of DV360 that will give me better reporting, automated segmenting and optimization?

It makes sense that many users receive 1 ad because users clear cookies and use multiple devices. We can cap the higher end of frequency within the platforms to keep it under control. But, what can be done to encourage frequency in the ideal range? From what I hear from our team, this is very difficult to do, even if we bid much higher for a second and third impression. This is across display, video and social. Any idea what options we should look into?

Hoping to get the community's insight into my professional goals. I've been out of college now for about 2 years now, working in programmatic media at a large NYC ad agency. I love the dynamic, fast-paced, data-driven aspects of programmatic media, and by the looks of it I am on track to become a trading director. However, my career is starting to reach a level of monotony after working on a variety of clients over the past few years (high-end luxury, CPG, Tech, B2B, hospitality). But as different as the clients and their goals are, the process at the end is really similar, at least from a trading perspective.  


Recently, I've became interest in the legal aspects of the industry (i.e. GDPR in the EU or the lack of regulation in the US). I'm now thinking about law school and possibly pursuing a career in understanding data privacy, and the more regulatory and legal aspects of ad tech. Is this something worth pursuing in the long term? I am not coming from a traditional background in pursuing a law degree, so I hope this will make me more appealing to ad tech companies after I graduate.   


Would love to know everyone's thoughts.

So I work a boutique marketing agency who was just approached by a local radio station to provide media buying (in addition to other services) for their clients. They currently use Simplfi, but want someone local to handle everything. I've been tasked with this, despite not having any experience in media buying. After a ton of research and some DSP demos, I feel like I have a pretty good grasp on the whole process, and we are due to give them a presentation on Thursday of how we would handle their programmatic media buying for a dummy HVAC account they provided. However, there are still a couple questions I can't figure out:

- They provided us a ""price list"" from Simplifi to try and match, guaranteeing them the following prices: 

· Display - $4 CPM 
· Video - $12 CPM
 · Native - $4 CPM 
· Social - $4 CPM 
· Mobile - $4 CPM

How can Simplifi guarantee those specific prices, if everything is through a bid system that is constantly changing?


- Would handling Google ads separately from the DSP make sense, or would it just be redundant?

- Without access to a DSP platform, I've been struggling to formulate any specific campaign ad spend. How could I come up with an average price per channel if I can't even access those channels?

There are more, but those are just a couple of the major ones. It's all quite overwhelming, so I'm trying to stay afloat with this whole thing. Any advice/help would be appreciated!

We use Adwords and DBM to buy TrueView ads. This post is directly relating to Adwords, and the recent trend of a large volume of children channels or videos when we use Interest/Demographic targeting. It's better with 'Topics' based targeting, but placements still creep in. 

Apart from using a whitelist of placement, we trawled around the web and found this script that we could run on Adwords accounts to automatically blacklist children channels based on a list of tags:

https://www.semrush.com/blog/how-to-exclude-childrens-channels-from-youtube-advertising/

We've managed to complete all the steps the creator has mentioned, and have gotten the script to run successfully. The expected outcome is that an exclusion list we create on our Adwords account will get populated with a list of channels. However, this hasn't been working as intended. The exclusion list remains the same regardless. 

None of us are particularly skilled at JavaScript or AWQL, so we're not really sure where we're going wrong, but have any of you guys come across this script in the past, or are able to understand how this works?

I was also wondering, can you promote in these two channels with a 3rd party tracking solution (Has Offers by tune, Cake..)?

Preferred Deals for Retargeting,3,7a3krc,https://www.reddit.com/r/programmatic/comments/7a3krc/preferred_deals_for_retargeting/,5,1509571940.0,"Hello Everyone, 

I recently moved from Ad Sales role at our company to a Programmatic buyer for Retargeting supply. Which means, I have to identify the publishers who are matching most number of Ad requests that are coming from the Devices that our retargeting Advertisers are looking to target and then setup Guaranteed deals with them to beat competition and increase Audience reach rate by attaining first look. The challenge I am facing is scale. There are no 5-6 publishers that are scaling up on the retargeting campaigns and the long tail is too big. This means I am not able to spend enough money and the publishers are getting annoyed. Is there another approach that you employ to identify which publishers have the Devices you are looking to target and then do deals only with them? We are practically employing a A/B test and then waiting to see the results on open marketplace before approaching the publishers. Any suggestions are welcome. 

Thanks,
Satya ",2017-11-01 16:32:20
TubeMogul vs DBM,4,792ty0,https://www.reddit.com/r/programmatic/comments/792ty0/tubemogul_vs_dbm/,5,1509135152.0,"Hi!

I have recently started working within the field of programmatic, that said I feel like I am slowly getting a more solid grasp of the concept of it. I was wondering if anyone could share some insights when working in TubeMogul as I just received a plan for a campaign using that specific DSP. I have previously solely been working in DBM and Adform seeing I am working from Sweden where we still lack a lot of DSP options. So to get to it here are some quick questions that I have accumelated within the hour of usage:

1. Support: Is there any live-chat support for TubeMogul to get ahold of quick fixes and answers to questions or is this something that they lack when compared to DBM's customer support? Say I was wondering why a flight has not started and I wanted a relatively quick answer.
2. The structure of the DSP goes in the following hierarchy Campaign -> Package -> Placements (right?) is this similar to the structure of DBM's way of Campaign -> IO -> Line Item?
3. The various pacing options are intimidating, have you gotten any good experience with each of them, mainly thinking of the Front Load vs Aggressive Front load or is Even the only way to go about campaigns? The usage of Front Load for me seems like a way to make sure that your Line items/strategies are able to pace with the assigned budget. Say you notice that it can handle more budget with Front load so you assign more budget and push it to even or does that not work?
4. Packaging. What benefits is there from assigning specific goals on a package level? Specifically thinking about the optimizing options that come from the package with optimization goal and target of that goal. How well does this work? say I set a lowest CPM goal and put a CPM target, what is the drawback of doing this? Will I see a great loss in won bids because it wont bid when above target or how does this really work?
5. When creating a campaign it gives me the option to manage margins, what does this mean?

a) when do digital agencies usually open up fall internships? 
b) what companies are the 'best' for programmatic? (name brand, work culture, rep)
c) what is the salary range for programmatic out of college? I've been reached out for $35k-50k

Billing for Programmatic management,3,6mdgr5,https://www.reddit.com/r/programmatic/comments/6mdgr5/billing_for_programmatic_management/,11,1499708984.0,"I'm from a PPC background whereby management of spend is generally covered by either:

- Per hour billing
- % of ad spend (varies from ~10% - 25% dependent on client/budget)
- Fixed fees
- Mixture of fixed fee/% of ad spend (i.e $1000 then X% of ad spend)

Does this translate well to programmatic? The amount of media spend is generally far higher and the effort to spend that much is generally far less than with PPC management. Presumably, % fee amounts are therefore far lower (5-10% dependent on spend)?

We're transparent as an agency and pride ourselves in our transparency, I've seen models where fees are baked into the client spend and that isn't overly interesting for us (i.e 10% slice taken off the top non-transparently). However presumably there is generally a link between $$$ spend vs. client fees with Programmatic?

Programmatic Career Pivot From PPC,3,et7lnl,https://www.reddit.com/r/programmatic/comments/et7lnl/programmatic_career_pivot_from_ppc/,23,1579883236.0,"Hi everyone,

Hope to get some advice here.

I am wondering how a career in programmatic is like. Previously I was in an agency specializing in Google and Facebook ads through search, social, YouTube, GDN and others for mainly small local businesses, but never really got in touch with other programmatic or enterprise level advertising tools.

I am interested in exploring programmatic, but most programmatic trading roles I have seen have about 15% drop in salary compared to paid media specialists roles. It seems that programmatic is much more technical to pick up but pays less, and I know a few digital marketing managers / head of marketing that have no idea how programmatic really works.

So my questions are

1. Is it worth to make the switch? Have any of you been in a similar situation and regretted it?
2. What is the typical career progression like?
3. I worry about being too specialized, one friend told me that I will lose touch of other channels like PPC, SEO, Email, CRM, Affiliate, as Programmatic is quite niche
4. How applicable are the skills and are we restricted once we decide to leave the agency? (relating back to point 3)

Any other input is also welcome. Thanks guys.",2020-01-24 10:27:16

This is a really important data point for us, as we are trying to limit outstream and other auto play video inventory.

Is Adx unable to report on playback method? It seems a little shady given all the other inventory sources do, and we are using DV360 so you’d think AdX and DV360 would enable the most accurate reporting.

I need help.

We have technology that extracts “premium” display inventory from RTB auctions. By “premium” I mean that this inventory can deliver conversions at a cost per acquisition 1.5x to 6.0x less than with contextual targeting alone.

But where to set that threshold for “premium?” If we set it too high the cost per acquisition is incredibly low, but the volumes are microscopic. I need help setting that threshold.

In other words, how much premium inventory is “enough?”

What would you typically spend on a premium campaign, in terms of monthly budget and bid, and how many impressions would you expect to win?

I understand how squishy this number is, but I would really appreciate your input.

If I get enough answers (from here and on other forums), I’ll summarize the results in a later post.

Going client side?,3,8kvc1u,https://www.reddit.com/r/programmatic/comments/8kvc1u/going_client_side/,12,1526877221.0,"Hi AdOps community, 

I have spent the last few years working at a programmatic media agency trading desk. Over time I have found it difficult to learn the real trade of media trading because no one is truly technical (i.e., no one really understands how ad serving works, what a bid request contains, how bidders work, how to evaluate data meaningfully to inform clients of their campaign performance). I guess the issue here is the entry to barrier is low.

There's always this notion of ""no one knows what to do"" at my company but yet no one actually takes the time out to figure it out. It seems to me everyone is just taking things at face value and never truly critically thinking through issues.

I am trying to figure out the pros and cons of going client side, specifically to do in house programmatic work. What are some of the things to watch out for? What are some of the upsides? From what I see, clients like to hire from agencies. But do they know that agency talent isn't always the most knowledgeable because there isn't a lot of technical/domain exposure? Also, there seems to be a very unclear career path once you transition over to client side.

The advertiser I work for, use a lot of programmatic publishers for prospecting campaigns, which obviously request the implementation of their pixels on our website to be able to optimize the campaign on the conversions generated.

However, while those pixels can be use for conversion measurement I assume it can also be use for audience collection.. which means that if the performance of their campaign are running low they could just turn on retargeting campaign and artificially boost their conversion rate.

Couple of questions on this topic,

1- What can I do to ensure those publishers are not boosting their performance by using retargeting campaigns ?
2- From an advertiser perspective, can I monitor what they do with their pixel and how they use the information they collect ?

The Trade Desk pixel not firing in DCM tag--help?,3,7g5ebz,https://www.reddit.com/r/programmatic/comments/7g5ebz/the_trade_desk_pixel_not_firing_in_dcm_taghelp/,12,1511915967.0,"Hey all. I'm not as familiar with tagging websites as I know some of you must be. 

The problem: 

I'm running a campaign in TTD and the client placed a TTD pixel I sent them in the DCM tag that is placed on the Thank You page. I'm seeing conversions in the DCM reports, but my TTD tags aren't firing. I tried image, iframe, and javascript pixels. No fires on anything. I've never had a client use DCM tags this way, and I'm not that experienced with DCM.

My client owns their DCM account, so the only information I have on set up is from a brief screenshare with them. Set up as an iframe, holding another tag that has been firing fine. I've ALWAYS used google container tags and couldn't really QA the set up since I wasn't familiar with it. 

Does anyone have any ideas here? I could really use a hand.

"Manipulating DFP tags so I can ""force"" it to exclude certain Deal-IDs",3,6h83ej,https://www.reddit.com/r/programmatic/comments/6h83ej/manipulating_dfp_tags_so_i_can_force_it_to/,3,1497481806.0,"I'm trying to figure out how can I ""force"" DFP (and not through the DFP UI) to exclude certain DEAL_ID. I'll explain:
a publisher, let's say CNN has DFP tags on its site.
A buyer, let's say Toyota established a deal (PMP) with CNN to buy traffic from them.
Toyota doesn't want to buy on specific pages, lets say cnn.com/demopage.html
Is there a way that a programmer of CNN can manipulate the DFP tag that is on that page in a way that DFP will know to not send traffic to the exchange with that deal-id. Basically what I want is a way to exclude the buyer from buying impressions from that page , when the buying is done using the PMP.
Again, I'm talking about a programmatic way , so I don't want the publisher to change/add settings inside the DFP console. I'm looking for a way to manipulate the tag. Maybe something like : googletag.defineSlot('/network_code/first_level_ad_unit/second_level_ad_unit', [width, height], 'div-gpt-ad-div_ID') .setCategoryExclusion('label_name')


My point is different. I'm looking for something that would help me ""manipulate"" the DFP tag from the client side, from the out side. Not inside the DFP UI. Here's the context - we are an ad tech company, who works with the brands' trading desks. They provide our tag to their publishers. We want, through our tag, that sits on the publisher's header, to block our client's (the brand's) deal-ID from bidding on a specific DFP ad unit, if we deem the impression as irrelevant. The publisher agrees, the advertiser agrees, the only problem is that we don't want to rely on the publisher to set it up in his DFP UI. We want to be able to do it from the outside (similarly to what header bidding does).

Can you please help here?

Promoting SaaS Solutions to Singapore Market using RTB Site Scout,3,6b8udy,https://www.reddit.com/r/programmatic/comments/6b8udy/promoting_saas_solutions_to_singapore_market/,3,1494859185.0,"Hi Media Buyers,

I'm new to this Programmatic Media buying, and am quite interested in trying this space. I have experience managing Google Display Network Campaigns, and have found Site Scout to be a good DSP Platform to start with a min $500 Deposit as a TEST Budget. 

I have opened an FREE account on Site scout, and am learning everything from Youtube Videos to Blogs on how to run an Profitable campaign.

I'm working in an Agency, and we have a client selling ERP Software Solutions. We are currently running their AdWords Campaign, however, we are not finding enough Leads, which is why I would like to TEST Site Scout.

Therefore, I have decided to start with only 2 Campaigns to gather enough data, and optimize. Below is the break down:



1. Search for competitors and do research using Mixrank, Quantcast and Alexa
2. Learn more on where my audience spends time, and choose those publishers site.
3. Setting up of Domain Targeting - White list and Retargeting campaign
4. Target Location - Singapore
5. CPM - Betwen $0.10 - $0.50 to start with, and thereafter will scale
6. Frequency Cap - 1 for every 12 hours or 1 for 48 hrs
6. Budget - $20/day to complete 1 Month Spending
7. Choose RON Network
8. Upload Creatives, mostly 300 * 250 (Because that works, and later expand to other banner sizes)
9. Split Test Ads and Landing pages
10. Optimize the ads, and scale it towards Profitability (Long Term)

Things to DO:

1. Paste the Conversion Pixel
2. Paste the Retargeting pixel on every page and create Audience list

Have I included everything, and what are the things to consider while optimizing?

Also, how do you guys pitch Programmatic Media Buying to your clients?

I see that there isn't much activity on this sub reddit, but I've become interested in programmatic advertising and was hoping to get advice from people working in this space on how to break into this industry. 

I have a fairly quantitative background. I worked in finance before making a switch to an ad agency where I worked for about a year (until June). It was at the agency that I first found out about and became interested in RTB/Programmatic advertising. 

I have some knowledge of these concepts, eg. DSP, SSP, Ad Network, Ad Exchange, etc, but am by no means an expert. 

I would ideally like to work at a Trade Desk or with a DSP. 

So I was hoping to find specific advice on:

1) How exactly do I break into this industry? (I've applied/interviewed at a few places including Havas and Vivaki but did not receive an offer.)

1b)How did you break into the industry? What do you like most about it? 

2) What specific companies should I target? (I'm hoping there are others besides AppNexus, X+1, MediaMath, Zenith, Vivaki, etc, that I haven't heard about.)

2b) Did you use a recruiting firm to break in? Which?

3) What specifically can I do during my time off to maximize my odds of getting a position? (I can only read so many ELI5 RTB things.) 

4) Anything else I need to know? The more the better! 

Again, I know there isn't much activity on this sub reddit, but any advice would be appreciated, as I'm very interested in breaking in. ",2014-11-05 03:15:19
The basic setup of a performance campaign.,3,2khdyu,https://www.reddit.com/r/programmatic/comments/2khdyu/the_basic_setup_of_a_performance_campaign/,2,1414460636.0,"Programmatic is well known for performance campaigns, so let's cover the basics of setting one up. 

After you have defined KPI's, tagged the pages, and received or made the plan yourself (of course using naming conventions), we want to setup the first part of the campaign. 

1. Create a campaign for prospecting. This can include contextually relevant channels or 3rd party data segments. I suggest creating a line item for each channel or 3rd party data segment you target just so it is easier to define which one is working best. 

2. Second, we want to create a retargeting campaign. This campaign will retarget the pixels placed originally in the landing pages, shopping cart, thank you pages, etc.. 


Note. It is a good idea to negative target the pixels on the page in the prospecting campaign so that you are serving to new audiences and users. This also goes for people who have converted already in the retargeting campaign unless you are serving a different message. 


This is a super basic overview, I invite you all to add to it or post your strategy so that others can learn. ",2014-10-27 20:43:56

The Main Benefits of Programmatic Buying,3,2fvdzu,https://www.reddit.com/r/programmatic/comments/2fvdzu/the_main_benefits_of_programmatic_buying/,2,1410259833.0,"My definition of programmatic marketing is that it's a framework using digital media that allows you to target the right people with the right message at the right time for the best price. For marketers and advertisers, programmatic makes all the sense in the world, after all that is our goal-to get our product shown to potential customers and clients under the conditions mentioned. 

Programmatic consists of various tools, media, and functionality working together in order to achieve the goals of a campaign. 

The main benefit of programmatic is that we are able to buy audiences across large portions of media-rather than buying media and hoping to reach your audience as is the tradition. Any of the major [DSP's \(Demand side platforms\)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demand-side_platform) have access to most of the available online media.


**Main Benefits:**

* *Lower cost*- save money by having lower cost than standard display and other digital media

* *Frequency control*- using one platform allows you to control global frequency across campaigns making the buy more efficient

* *Performance*- with all the data available, performance and results are generally better

* *Scale*- unprecedented access to scale campaigns with inventory in every country and all sorts of formats

* *Automation*- do more with less people, what used to require a team, now a couple of people can execute

* *Control*-total control at your fingertips with the ability to blacklist sites, create private deals, specify browsers and devices to target among other things 

* *Insights*-gather a huge amount of data when a campaign is properly tracked and pixeled providing insights and other actionable information

Hey Reddit universe, I am currently looking to increase the revenue from our video content by adding a programmatic provider to our videos and live broadcasts. We are very new to the space so wanted to see if the community had any recommendations as to who or what company we should partner with. We create a significant amount of content currently that is going un-monetized.  Any help would be amazingly appreciated!",2019-11-25 19:11:25

I would love to hear your story about working with data exchanges and selling this type of 1st party data.

So far I'm talking to Deepintent, Proclivity and Eyota. In my opinion, its a scale business and as many as possible programmatic connections should be established. My shortlist includes Dawex, Phunware, Lotame, Adsquare.

Keen to make contacts with interested parties and chat with fellow pros with this kind of experience. Any tips or experiences?

Are programmatic direct/guaranteed bad for DSPs (relative to PMP and open exchange),2,d8b9nj,https://www.reddit.com/r/programmatic/comments/d8b9nj/are_programmatic_directguaranteed_bad_for_dsps/,6,1569294618.0,"question:

Since advertiser/publisher establish direct relationship, I would think that gives less leverage to middlemen. In fact, why do you even need a DSP if you're just going directly to the publisher?

So I would think DSPs should have a lower take rate for PG deals vs say PMP or open exchange.  As PG deals become a bigger part of mix, that should be bad for DSP profitability

Can anyone confirm if this is true/ share anecdotes on this?  any feedback would be appreciated.  I'm an outsider thinking of investing in TradeDesk.
